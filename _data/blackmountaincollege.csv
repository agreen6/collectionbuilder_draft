Hence this Newsletter gives a brief survey of Black Mountain's general program of education for democratic citizenship- a program which in the current emergency constitutes a definite and direct con­tribution to America's war effort.    Black Mountain moves into its tenth year at a time when it is imperative that young people share as fully as possible in the work of their coun­try. The College now has mature experience in evolving methods for preparing young men and women for citizenship, and means through which they can make their greatest social contribution today. The ap­proach of the College's tenth anni­versary find's the staff deep in preparations for the imminent sum­mer program, which will include three things: Summer Study Quarter of eleven weeks, beginning July 5, with regular academic study as pro­vided under the new year- round plan; a Summer Work Camp run­ning concurrently with the study program and offering a limited num­ber of young men and women oppor­tunity to contribute to the war effort, in a congenial environment where they may participate in stimu­lating educational and community activities; and a six weeks' Seminar on America for foreign scholars, teachers, and artists (July 1 to Au­gust 12) under the direction of Black Mountain's Professor of Sociology, Dr. Herbert A. Miller. Dr. Miller was instrumental in founding and has been resident director of similar Seminars sponsored by the Ameri­can Friends' Service Committee each summer since 1940. Summer school registrants, Work Campers, and Seminar enrollees will all be regard­ed as members of the College com­munity, free to participate in all community activities.    Black Mountain has always believed that American democracy has its roots in people who have the train­ing,  physique, and convictions vital to a democracy. Therefore, believ­ing that young people must have the opportunity of being directly confronted by some of the main tasks that exist for the individual in our day- such as making one's personal and immediate contribution to national life, and at the same time improving oneself in practical skills and in intellectual and spiritual stamina- the College this summer again offers a Work Camp as an adjunct to its general educational    2    BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE BULLETIN Newsletter April 1943  Volume I Number 3  Issued four times a year, in November, January, February, and April. Ap­plication for entry as second- class matter at the Postoffice at Black Moun­tain, N. C., under the Act of August 24, 1912, is pending.     program. It is hoped that for some Work Campers this period of part time physical work with partici­pation in academic, musical, dra­matic, and artistic activities, and  with a healthful outdoor program of water sports and hiking, will serve as an introduction to the regular College work in the fall term.    Some information may be given here to new readers of this Letter, who may not know the College but may be interested in coming here this summer term or the following. The College is located on a mountainside overlooking North Carolina's North Fork Valley. The Craggy Mountains, Mount Mitchell, and the famous Sky­line Drive are very near. Lying fifteen miles east of Asheville and five miles west of the town of Black Mountain, the College is in a com­pletely rural setting. There is fre­quent bus service to both centers. The property comprises nearly 800 acres of beautiful woodland in an area which is one of the richest botanical districts of the United States. The College's Lake Eden provides swimming and boating facilities and furnishes the focal point for the College buildings, of which there are twenty-four. Black Mountain is in the heart of a famous summer resort section at an elevation of 2400 feet, and has cool nights and warm summer days.    Work Campers and other members of the community who wish to do so will participate this summer in the College farm and building projects, engaging in such work as gardening, logging, construction, and mainte­nance work. Activities of Work Campers will be of two main kinds: farming and building construction. Black Mountain's farm program is no ""made"" program, but a real project which has grown with the College in its progress toward the greatest possible self-sufficiency. In  war time the program has taken on even wider significance and has been broadened this year in order that the College may engage as fully as possible in the war program of pro­duction and conservation. The Col­lege farm now is producing milk, beef, pork, and eggs for the College, as well as food for meat and milk herds. This year a vegetable truck garden of several additional acres has been added.    The work of campers is usually scheduled in the morning hours, thus providing opportunity for healthful  relaxation and participation in other activities. Campers will do five hours' work per day during the week. Board, room, and tuition is pro­vided at $12.50 per week, and actual class- work in the liberal arts is offer­ed at slight additional cost. The Work Camp group usually comprises  young men and women of college age. This year, in order that neces­sary work may go on and in order to  assure a representative number of masculine campers, a few capable of junior and senior high school work  will also be considered. Because of limited enrollment, letters of appli-cation should be submitted as early as possible to the Work Camp, Black Mountain College, Black Mountain, North Carolina.    Black Mountain has conducted a Summer Work Camp since 1941. During these years the Work Camp for architectural students has been especially valuable. The Work Camp's active laboratory in archi­tecture will be again undcr the di­rection of A Lawrence Kocher, dis­tinguished modern architect, who heads the Black Mountain Department of Architecture. It provides field experience and supplements the drafting board and classroom work in field surveying, construction work, and building supervision. This year's Camp will make special use of local building materials, and will deal also with new materials, eco­nomical construction, and post- war planning. Such institutions as Har­vard University have contributed a number of graduate students to the  Work Camp of Black Mountain Col­lege.    Seminar on America  The Seminar on America is planned to provide an opportunity for quali­fied newcomers to this country with  specialized training to accelerate their adjustment to American com­munity life and to get a better under­standing of American democracy and history. Emphasis will be placed upon principles and methods of edu­cation.    The Seminar should especially in­terest adults who need to improve ­their English and their general orientation to the American com­munity and to American education as related to their professions, as well as those professional people in­terested in the Seminar program who are in need of a summer's rest and adjustment period in pleasant sur­roundings. Courses will provide in­tensive tutoring in written and oral English, lectures on America, Amer­ican history and government, litera­ture and education. As the College will be in session throughout the summer, members of the Seminar group will be free to participate in all campus activities and social events and in contacts with students and teachers, who represent many different sections of America and a number of foreign countries. They will share such college interests as instrumental and choral music, dra­matic productions, art and architec­ture projects, and will have access to the College's recreational facilities and the College library and music library. They may, if they wish, ob­serve or take part in the College's regular work program of farm, building, and maintenance tasks. Fees of $ 110 will cover all expenses of board, room, and college tuition for the six weeks' session. Applica­tions may be addressed to Dr Her­bert A Miller at the College.    A savings plan  At the time of the armistice the American armed forces will find themselves somewhcre in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Several additional months will pass before  they will see American shores again. When eventually demobilization be­gins, say in 1945 or 1946, there will  be many among the veterans who had been forced by the war to interrupt their studies, or who had not been able to start them. Many among them may be inclined toward these studies. The war will have    3    taught them how necessary it is to gain a deeper insight into human affairs and a broader knowledge of history. They will understand how important it is to gain a professional or vocational training. Nevertheless they may doubt whether they are justified in following their inclina­tions- for obvious reasons. They may wish to get married and to become financially independent. Their de­cision must be made in time of transition. Even the best post-war preparations can not prevent hasic changes. It will take years before the nation becomes adapted to the new conditions. There will be years of insecurity and risks; but there will also be great opportunities for the man who begins his work at once. Under such circumstances who will have the courage and patience to devote several more years to studies? Will not parents of these veterans feel that their responsibility of educating has ended?    If young people of the war genera­tion repudiate further study, the nation will lose whole classes of citi­zens with trained talents at a time when such citizens will be most  urgently needed; and the veterans who justly have the first claim, will lose the advantages which education and training would give them in the long run. In addition, colleges would continue to suffer from depletion of their student bodies for many years after the war. The tradition of liberal arts once interrupted cannot be easily revived.    As yet there is no national organi­zation which encourages and aids young people, both soldiers and  workers, men and women, to resume their studies.    The Faculty, therefore, early in April unanimously accepted a plan worked out by Dr Erwin Straus during the Spring Vacation. The College had already presented a plan for the edu­cation of veterans. Although this has  been favorably received by the War Department, there have been diffi­culties in the way of its execution. However, according to our latest in­formation, it is still under con­sideration.    This second plan could be added to or substituted for the  first, since they differ in scope and administration. The former plan dealt exclusively with the education of veterans, emphasized the edu­cational problems of the duration, and assumed the financial responsi­bility of the government; while the second plan includes civilians as well as soldiers, looks forward to the post-war situation, and is based upon self-help.    The plan is based on the assumption that many with the Armed Forces, with the WAAC and WAVES, or working in essential industries could now save the funds necessary for future studies.    Therefore, those who look forward to taking up study after the war should now choose a college or uni­versity  and apply for admission. If admitted they should start to pay monthly in installments the annual fees set by their chosen institution at the time of their entrance into the savings plan. The completed pay­ment for one or more academic years should guarantee them the right to study for a corresponding period, whatever the fees of the institution may be later on. Thus they will ac­quire  a claim protected against in­flation. Those whose studies are interrupted by the war should make    4    appropriate arrangements with their college for continued studies under this plan. The amounts paid would be accepted and deposited by a spe­cial savings trust company incorpor­ated under federal and state law.  The amount paid would remain at the disposal of the applicants. After the war they could choose to enter a  college or university or to get their money back.     Early in April the plan was sent to a small number of eminent edu­cators, bankers, and government officials. Answers received thus far have all been very sympathetic with the plan. However, there has not yet  been a sign that anyone is going to take the initiative to realize these ideas. Therefore, the Faculty has de­cided  that we will go ahead by our­selves. We hope that our step will increase interest in this plan and precipitate acceptance on a nation-wide scale. If this should happen we would probably join such a national organization.    We are now preparing the organi­zation of the Savings Fund for Black Mountain College. This fund will be kept completely independent of col­lege finances. The Savings Fund will be administered by a group of trus­tees  in co-operation with one of the big banks or with a foundation, so the security of the savings will not suffer even if the College would not survive one of its many crises.    We are now sending individual letters to our alumni in order to get information from them regarding the number who are interested in joining the organization. We expect also to hear from people who, al­though  interested in such a plan in general, are inclined for one reason or another, to begin or to complete their work at other institutions.    Nevertheless, those who later on would prefer another college would, in writing to us now, help to realize their own intentions. For, if in our publicity, we can report a widespread interest in this plan, this might well influence other colleges to follow our example or it might push for­ward a nation-wide organization, as foreseen in our plan.    Recent publicity    In an introduction to four pages of pictures of life at Black Mountain presented in a recent issue of Click  Magazine, editors of the publication described the college as ""an experi­ment in education, a blueprint for  democracy at work . . . In the post­war world, this college may take the lead in pointing the way to a new type of training for our youth.    ""If the war is to mean anything, it must lead the way to a greater re­gard of man for his fellow man"", the Click article continues. "" Paradoxically, that job begins on the  battlefields of the world. But it must also be done in the schools and col­leges. To educate is not enough. Youth must be trained in co-opera­tion and democracy.    ""Black Mountain tries to do the job in two ways. It educates through an inter-related program of subjects  where the influence of historv on literature is covered in a single course, where philosophy and the social sciences become a study of man's problems in the terms of the student's own experiences. It trains through a work program which teaches students the proper use of    5    tools, gives them a community sense and responsibility about their work. . . That the program of Black Mountain has been successful is evi­dent in the way students speak about the college . . . you know you've found a school which can't die, a school which will continue to build itself into a highly important insti­tution.""    The College program is illustrated in seventeen photographs depicting settings, classes and laboratory work and showing representative students and teachers engaged in various typical community activities.    College notes    Black Mountain College textiles that were exhibited at the Mint Museum in Charlotte during January were later, by invitation, exhibited in Louisville, Kentucky, under the  sponsorship of Lou Tate.     Black Mountain College observed Negro History Week in February. The features of the Week were: a lecture by Dr Herbert A Miller on ""The Contributions of the Negro  to American Culture Patterns"", a lecture by Kenneth Kurtz on ""Literary Contributions of the Ne­gro"", a showing by Josef Albers of slides on Negro Art from the Metro­politan Museum of Art, a showing of the Harmon Foundation techni­color film on Hampton Institute, and an informal talk on ""The Negro Problem"" by W A Robinson, Di­rector of the Negro Secondary School  Study.    Students and teachers of Black Mountain College participated in the Second Western North Carolina Drama Festival in Asheville in March. Elsa Kahl presented a group of stu­dents from the Eukinetics classes in a half-hour program of body move­ments. Robert Wunsch, the Chair­man of the Festival, gave a demon­stration in directing, using a scene from "" Ethan Frome"".    Faculty news    Josef Albers attended the second annual Carolina Workshop Spring Festival at Chapel Hill in April and  participated in a panel discussion on ""The Artist in the Post War Peace"". Also on the panel were James Boyd,  the author of Drums, Struthers Burt, the author of Along These Streets, and Howard Thomas, a painter.    ""Designing"", a paper by Anni Albers, has been accepted for publication by the American Craftsmen's Co­operative  Council in the May issue of their magazine, Craft Horizons.    The February 6 issue of The Nation contained an article, ""Literature and the Third Reich"", by Dr Eric Bent­ley. The current issue of The Antioch Review contains another article by Dr Bentley; it is entitled ""Bernard  Shaw, Caesar, and Stalin"".    Frederic Cohen's compositions, ""A Spring Tale"" and ""The Prodigal Son"", were recently performed in  the British cities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield.    The Advisory Board of the Ameri­can Council of Learned Societies at a recent meeting voted a grant of $950.00 toward the cost of publish­ing Secret Chromatic Art in Nether­lands Motet by Dr Edward E Lowin­sky.    6    7    Early in April Dr Herbert A Miller attended the two days' conference in Philadelphia on The Future of Asia and spoke on ""Asia's Struggle for Freedom"" and ""Dynamic Patterns of Asia"".    Dr Erwin Straus will present a paper on ""Depersonalization: Its Signifi­cance for Psychology and Psycho­pathology"" before the North Caro­lina Academy of Science at Duke University on May 1.    Trudi Straus participated as violinist in the March concerts in Asheville, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh by the  North Carolina Symphony Orchestra.    Robert Wunsch was the chief speaker at two recent monthly meet­ings of the Western North Carolina Schoolmasters' Club. He talked on ""Progressive Education in American Secondary Schools and Colleges"" and on ""Objectives, Procedures and Evaluations in Secondary Education"".    Accepts new post    Dorothy Trayer left Black Moun­tain College on April 24 for Con­cord, New Hampshire, to take up her new duties as laboratory tech­nician at the diagnostic laboratory of the State Board of Health. During her stay here she was College Registrar and a piano student under Frederic Cohen.    Visitors    Dr Frederick H Koch, director of the Carolina Playmakers, spent a week-end recently at Lake Eden. A  College audience heard him in in­formal  readings from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology and other American poetry which he  believes possesses great possibilities for dramatic interpretation.     Miss Eunice Miller, Supervisor of the Investigation Division of Child Guardianship in the Massachusetts  Department of Public Welfare, was a College visitor during April. Dur­ing her stay she spoke informally to  a College audience on ""A State and Its Children,"" giving an outline of the social program of Massachusetts for its young people.    Miss Agnes Tweedie, Head of the College Bureau at the Anacostia High School in Washington, D C, and Lecturer in Education at George Washington University, spent her  spring vacation at Lake Eden.    Rachel Dwinell, for two years a sec­retary to the Black Mountain Col­lege Faculty and now Program As­sistant  in the YMCA at Fort Slo­cum, near New Rochelle, New York, was a recent visitor. She said that in carrying out her duties of meeting and talking with soldiers there are  many opportunities ""to set up chan­nels of thinking about what tolerance and democracy really mean"".    William T McCleery, editor of PM's Picture News, will spend several days at ­the College the first week in May.    Among the other recent visitors to the College were: Miss Ilse Hoff­man, Gretel Lowinsky's sister; Jules Schwerin, who is connected with the Office of Imports of the Board of Economic Wadare; Mr and Mrs Alexander Kopp, the parents of Anatole Kopp, instructor of archi­tecture at the College; Terry West, a  student at Barnard; Mr and Mrs. Harry Oppenheimer, the parents of Herbert; Ruth Bucher, Barbara Payne's sister, and her hushand, Lieutenant Bucher; ils Haugaard, Erik's hrother, a student at the Uni­versity of Philadelphia; Mr J B Jamieson of Newton Centre, Massa­chusetts; and Homer Bobilin, who spent his vacation at Lake Eden after having completed a course at a Code School in New York City.    Derek Bovingdon    Lieutenant Derek Bovingdon, for three years, before his entrance into the Army Air Forces, a student at Black Mountain College, was killed in a bomber crash in Washington State on May 29. Very little is known about the accident, but it is supposed that unfavorable weather conditions were the cause of it. Derek had re­ceived his commission on January 4 with a class in which he was one of the nine top ranking men. He was  sent immediately with his high rank­ing eight classmen to Hobbs, New Mexico; there he learned to fly the B- 17F, the Flying Fortress. He was not required to go through the usual preliminary step of being a co-pilot,  but was entrusted at once with the duties of a pilot. From Hobbs he was sent to Ephrita, Washington. On the day that Derek received his com­mission he and Barbara Sieck, for­merly a student at Black Mountain College, were married.     Memorial Services were held for Derek in the Quiet House at Lake Eden on Sunday, April 11. After the A Capella group had sung a Bach Chorale, ""Es 1st Genug"", Rector Robert Wunsch read an excerpt from a letter from Charles Lindsley, de­scribing Derek as a student at Blue Ridge and at Lake Eden; then Theo­dore  Dreier spoke briefly about Derek. He said of him, in part: ""He is one of those people inseparably associated in our minds with the building of this place, Lake Eden.  But his association was with the peo­ple about him no matter what was being done, and his generous en­thusiasm and zest for action won him friends easily. He was perhaps the closest link we have ever had with the village of Black Mountain, where he was trusted, admited and liked ... He came here as a boy and went away a man prepared to do his share in the struggle for victory that we are now engaged in ... At this moment Derek's passing has more than usual portent for us because he is the first to give his life among the many who have gone and are going, prepared to do likewise if  necessary. In time of war we cannot escape till so late in life the chal­lenge of death that comes. We are apt to feel pretty inadequate to find and help create anything sufficiently significant to balance the sorrow and help it to make sense. Yet that is what it's up to us to do and I  believe actually that death can make us understand more vividly what our opportunities are while we are  still here and give us strength to dedicate ourselves and persist in see­ing to it that our friends and those  whom we love shall not have given their lives for nothing.""    Former students    After six months at Guadalcanal as a private, first class, in the Marines, Emery Whipple recently spent a short leave at his home in Concord, Massachusetts. He enlisted in the Marines two weeks before the at­tack on Pearl Harbor.    Bertrand Richard has heen reported    8    missing in Tunisia. It is possible that he was taken prisoner.    Ensign Bela Martin is now in the South Pacific.    Jack Roberts has been in North Africa since last November.    Corporal John M Stix is now re­cuperating in the Hospital at Camp Butner near Durham, North Caro­lina, from a serious attack of menin­gitis.    John J Kasik was recently graduated from the 0 C S at Fort Monmouth in Red Bank, New Jersey.    George Hendrickson received his commission on February 11 at Fort Davis. He is now stationed at Long  Beach, California.    Lieutenant Morris Simon is now stationed at Fort Bragg where he is working in a Plans and Training De­partment.

Suzanne Nohle has been granted a scholarship in psychology for the second semester at Radcliffe College.    Jimmy Jamieson is now working as an attendant at the Brattleboro Re­treat in Brattleboro, Vermont.    Former teachers    Private John Evarts, stationed at Miami Beach in Florida, recently played the role of the father in the camp production of Maxwell Ander­son's ""The Eve of St Mark"". The play was directed hy Morgan Farley.    Bedford Thurman was graduated at the 0 C S in Miami Beach, Florida, on April 16. He is now in the Spe­cial Service in Lexington, Virginia.    Robert Baboock is now assistant chief of the Intelligence Division of the Board of Economic Warfare in Washington, D C.    9    Lecture series    The evening programs at the College have included a lecture series, at­tended not only by members of the College community but by soldiers from the Moore General Hospital and the Twenty - Eighth Training  Center at Swannanoa. The speakers for the series have come almost en­tirely from the faculty. Among them have been: Dr Eric Bentley, who ad­dressed the College on ""The War ­Its Nature and Origin""; Josef Albers, who gave a slide-illustrated lecture on ""Leonardo da Vinci""; Dr Ed­ward E Lowinsky, who spoke on ""Leonardo Da Vinci""; Dr Fritz Hansgirg, who gave three experiment- illustrated talks on "" Acoustical Problems in Music""; Barney Voigt, who gave a slide-illustrated lecture on ""The Italian Gardens of the Re­naissance""; and Dr Frances de Graaff, who spoke on ""The Soviet Union Today.""    Dramatics    There were two major productions during the Winter Quarter: the Owen Davis - Donald Davis dramati­zation  of Edith Wharton's ""Ethan Frome"" and Moliere's "" Le Malade Imaginaire"". The settings for ""Ethan Frome"" were designed by Anatole Kopp and constructed, under his di­rection, by his students in Stage Technique. The costumes for ""Le Malade Imaginaire"" were designed  and created by Jane Slater and Marilyn Bauer.    In the North Carolina State Dra­matic Festival, held in Chapel Hill in March, Black Mountain College was awarded first place in each of the four contests it entered. The prize winning entries were: Otis Levy's original farce, ""The Insanity of Love"" in the One- Act Play Con­test; Will Hamlin's ""Mr Whitcomb and the Horse"" in the Radio Script Contest; the costume plates by Jane Slater and Marilyn Bauer for ""Le Malade lmaginaire"" in the Costume Design Contest; and the set designs and floor plans by Anatole Kopp for the Lake Eden production of ""Ethan Frome"" in the Stage Design Contest.    Sketches of Anatole Kopp's stage designs for "" Ethan Frome"" with an accompanyillg article on his methods of using new and inexpensive ma­terials will probably appear in a summer issue of a national theatre magazine.    The major dramatic production of the Spring Quarter will be Charlotte Chorpenning's ""The Elves and the  Shoemaker"", a fairy play. It will be presented at the Plaza Theatre in Asheville under the sponsorship of  the Asheville Junior League on May 15 for thirteen hundred school chil­dren. Later it will be produced for the Asheville Negro children at the Stephens-Lee High School.    Advanced students in dramatics will present in May a bill of one- act plays including Paul Green's "" Fix­in's"", Strindberg's "" The Stronger"", and Noel Coward's "" Fumed Oak"".    Music    As an innovation in the widely at­tended course on Mozart's Operas conducted by Dr. Heinrich Jalowetz,  pictorial libretti designed by Anni Albers, Bill Reed and Anatole Kopp have been successfully used as an optical complement to the complete recordings of "" Don Giovanni"" and    10    ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" from Dr Fritz Hansgirg's record collection.     In addition to the Saturday evening concerts which have been played to an audience considerably increased by soldiers and officers of the new Moore General Hospital, the Music Department has given concerts in Asheville and in the Hospital and has broadcast every second week over Station WWNC on the College's radio program.    The A Capella group conducted by Dr Edward E Lowinsky presented a lecture-concert ""Music in Mediaeval Society"" with slides on February 6. The group is preparing at present a similar concert, ""Music of the Re­naissance."" The College Chorus under the direction of Dr Jalowetz, gave a special concert on March 18 with  works by Beethoven and Brahms.    Another addition to the Music Curriculum is a Piano Seminar in which Frederic Cohen's music stu­dents meet to become acquainted with the Piano repertoire, sight read­ing, analysis and ensemble playing.     During Easter Week Dr Fritz Han­girg played to the College commu­nity a recorded unabridged perform­ance of Bach's Passion of St Mat­thew.    Radiana Pazmore, contralto, a mem­ber of the Converse College Music Department, gave a song recital at Black Mountain College on March 13.  Miss Pazmore was accompanied at the piano by Dr Nowak, acting Dean of the Music Department of Converse.    Four music cubicles, designed by Architect Lawrence Kocher, are being built behind the College tennis courts by architecture and music stu­dents under the direction of Anatole Kopp. They are wood construction with sawdust insulation.    Theodore Dreier and Gorman Matti­son are on extendcd trips in the East in the interest of the financial pro­gram  of the College. They are ex­pected to return to Lake Eden early in May.    Art book campaign    In the middle of January Josef Albers inauguratcd a campaign to obtain books for the College Art Department. He sent out seventy letters to personal fricnds, including his former students at the Bauhaus and at Harvard, as well as at Black Mountain College, and accompanied these letters with mimeographed cir­culars describing thc art needs of the College.    The surprisingly good response to these letters encouraged Mr Albers to send out one hundred and eighty more letters and circulars. The mail­ing list this time included, as well as names of alumni and friends of the College, the names of museum directors and art dealers all over the United States. More than half of the  museums and art galleries responded positively in one way or another, sending catalogues, reproductions and photographs. About twenty- five percent of the alumni of Black Mountain College responded.    To date the Art Department has re­ceived more than two hundred and fifty books and reproduction folders, several hundred illustrated cata­logues, museum bulletins, reproduc-    11    tions and photographs, and ahout two hundred and fifty slides. The Department has received also more than six hundred dollars in cash gifts. Of this amount two hundred dollars has come from alumni. More contributions have been promised. The Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard will send books, reproduc­tions and slides. Several art institu­tions have placed Black Mountain College on their permanent mailing lists to receive future publications.    From the cash gifts received the Art Department has bought books, slides and color reproductions.    In commenting on the campaign, Mr Albers said, in part: "" I believe that in addition to bringing us many useful books which we needed very much, the campaign was worthwhile from an advertising viewpoint; it informed quite a number of people about Black Mountain College and stimulated quite a few of them to help us now and later. In general, the campaign proved that the Col­lege and the Art Department are known and approved of.""    The College is deeply appreciative of the gifts and the spirit that prompted the donors to send them.",State Archives of North Carolina;,"Yandle, Ashley",,,Text;,,,,2013-10-03,2013-10-03,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll44/id/551,552.cpd,Volume3/106-1.url,/p249901coll44/supp/551/index.pdf

The cooperative building project- in 1940-41 of a seventy-five room modern build­ing-  not only assists in the solution of an economic problem but also constitutes, through the work program, an extension of one of the College's educational ideas.    The idea of some manual work for students is a corollary of the College's concept of general education. Voluntary practical activi­ties, on different levels, have always been regarded as part of gen­eral education and as indispensable to the full development of the  student. The participation by students in the present building pro­ject is, then, the fruition of a fundamental idea rather than an in­novation or a change in ideology. Nevertheless, the project is of much greater scope than previous undertakings and plays a larger role in the community life.    The work program does not interfere with academic study but tends to enhance it through the general invigoration produced by intelligently varied activity. Students volunteer for three to nine hours of work a week, depending on their schedules and their  strength. Once they have signed up to work on fixed days, they are expected to appear on those days unless illness prevents. Many members of the faculty and staff also participate in the project on the same basis. Thus it is a community enterprise and provides an­other  area for free and informal contact as well as a point of com­mon interest.    The buildings were designed with a modern construction appro­priate to non-professional workers. The program includes all types of work that the erection of such buildings on a new site entails:    land clearing, road building, ditching, landscaping, digging of wall and pillar foundations, procuring of building stone, carpentry, masonry, and, at a later stage, wiring, plumbing, and other interior finishing. The designing of furniture and textiles is also con­templated.    Participation in the building program has shown itself to be val­uable in many ways, the most obvious being the regular outdoor exercise that it provides. For all students it is a broadening experi­ence. Most do manual labor for the first time. The majority, by  doing the types of work that are the occupations and the means of livelihood of a large section of the country's population, increase to some degree their understanding of society, gain more respect for  skilled workmanship, and adopt a less superficial and more sym­pathetic attitude toward necessary hard work and toward those who perform it. The work program also affords an opportunity for the development of resourcefulness, practical judgment, and the ability  to cope with certain kinds of emergency. As they do in craft work, students may learn that materials have limitations and laws of their own and that working with them requires discipline and technique.  Some students attain a fair degree of skill in one or more of the types of work involved; and for most students the first-hand acquaintance with modern architectural thought and materials is a  valuable experience, particularly since housing is so vital a na­tional concern. Finally, they can see how individuals' efforts com­bined into group activity can overcome difficult obstacles and change  a plan into a reality.    The cooperative aspect of the program should be emphasized not only in regard to its educational benefits but also in regard to the material economy which it effects. By undertaking most of the  labor itself, the community has helped solve a pressing financial problem and hopes' to make it possible for the College to move to its own property in September, 1941. That this is so gives a serious­ness  and a reality to the work which no manufactured enterprise could give. One result is a strong morale, springing from a com­mon purpose and from the satisfaction of concrete achievement.    The relation of the work program to the academic curriculum is contrapuntal rather than harmonic. There is, of course, a direct laboratory connection with Architecture, and in some degree with  Art and Economics. But the main importance is in the opening ofanother area of activity and experience. A student's studies may be made less rarified; but the real point is that the student himselfmay be made less so.    Supervision of the work program is in expert hands. The organiza­tion and management of the volunteer work crews is handled by a democratically chosen Work Committee of studcnts and faculty; and from day to day straw bosses are made rcsponsible for par­ticular  jobs. The well-known architect, Mr A Lawrence Kocher,  who is Visiting Professor of Architecture at the College and Resi­dent Artist sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, designed the buildings and is superintending their erection. Mr Charles Godfrey, an experienced builder and contractor of Black Mountain, oversees  all actual construction and helps instruct workers. The chairman of the Work Committee is Dr Richard Gothe, who was released by the National Youth Commission to join the College's faculty as Professor of Economics and to make a study, under the auspices of  the General Education Board, of the place of a work program in a liberal arts college. Heading a steering committee to coordinate all phases of the work program and the building project is Mr Theodore Dreier, Professor of Mathematics and Treasurer of the  College since its founding.    The particular synthesis of the Black Mountain experiment differs in a number of respects from similar projects being tried and in use elsewhere. The College believes that the conclusions reached and the technique established may prove useful and applicable in  other institutions which, on the one hand, acknowledge some truth in the contemporary cry for ""practical education"", but which, on the other hand, do not wish to sacrifice any of the values of a lib­eral arts education. The program also illustrates one manner in  which an institution, without detriment to its primary educational function, may help itself economically, and thus decrease the finan­cial assistance which it needs from outside sources.    The architect's sketch of the building begun in September, 1940, appears on the first page of this bulletin. Designed to make the best use of novice workers and of building materials on the property, it  will cost less than half of what it would cost if built by a contractor. The ground floor, from the hillside to the terrace under the building, and the fire-tower, against the hillside, are of masonry in native  stone. The greater part of the building is supported by concrete and steel columns in cantilever construction. The sheathing of the outer walls is of large corrugated sheets of Transite, an abestos synthetic, the sections of which are easily screwed in place. The continuous steel- sash windows are of the projecting type and run  almost the length of the two upper floors. The skeleton of the building is timber, with inner walls of plywood over an acoustical core. The roof is built of alternate layers of asphalt and heavy building paper, gravel- surfaced for walking and for fireproofing.  This building is the largest of the group of four shown in the plan on the back page, and contains sixty student studies, ten faculty studies, and studios for the Art Department. The group of buildings is situated at the northwest edge of the lake, between the hillside  and the water. When buildings and landscaping are completed, the two main wings of the group will roughly parallel the lakeshore, at a distance of about twenty- five yards. The three other units that the  whole plan calls for- a second student studies building, a library, and a small building for offices- will be constructed as rapidly as finances and time permit. The first unit, together with the already existing buildings and some faculty houses to be erected, will pro­vide  sufficient space to house the College during 1941- 42. As the other units are completed, the College can expand, and will be modestly quartered for a number of years. At a later date it is planned gradually to replace the old buildings ( which are being remodelled for present use) by the buildings designed in 1939 by  Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. This plan for growth avoids waste, since the old buildings will be used as long as it is economical, and all new buildings will fit into a comprehensive building scheme.

We have no picture of it which is all-inclusive, such as former times may have had. We have to make a choice between concepts of great diversity. And as a common ground is wanting, we are baffled by them. We must find our way back to simplicity of conception in order to find ourselves. For  only by simplicity can we experience meaning, and only by exper­iencing meaning can we become qualified for independent com­prehension.    In all learning today dependence on authority plays a large part, because of the tremendous field of knowledge to be covered in a short time. This often leaves the student oscillating between admir­ation and uncertainty; with the well-known result that a feeling  of inferiority is today common both in individuals and in whole nations.    Independence presumes a spInt of adventurousness - a faith in one's own strength. It is this which should be promoted. Work in a field where authority has not made itself felt may help toward this goal. For we are overgrown with information, decorative maybe,  but useless in any constructive sense. We have developed our receptivity and have neglected our own formative impulse. It is no accident that nervous breakdowns occur more often in our civiliza­tion  than in those where creative power had a natural outlet in daily activities. And this fact leads to a suggestion: we must come down to earth from the clouds where we live in vagueness and experience the most real thing there is: material.    Civilization seems in general to estrange men from materials, from materials in their original form. The process of shaping these is so divided into separate steps that one person is rarely involved in  the whole course of manufacture, often knowing only the finished product. But if we want to get from materials the sense of direct­ness, the adventure of being close to the stuff the world is made of,  we have to go back to the material itself, to its original state, and from there on partake in its stages of change.    We use materials to satisfy our substantial needs and our spiritual ones as well. We have useful things and beautiful things - equip­ment and works of art. In earlier civilizations there was no clear separation of this sort. The useful thing could he made beautiful in the hands of the artisan, who was also the manufacturer. His  creative impulse was not thwarted by drudgery in one section of a long and complicated mechanical process. He was also a creator. Machines reduce the boredom of repetition. On the other hand they permit play of the imagination only in the planning of the product.    Material, that is to say unformed or unshaped matter, is the field where authority blocks independent experimentation less than in many other fields, and for this reason it seems well fitted to become  the training ground for invention and free speculation. It is here that even the shyest beginner can catch a glimpse of the exhilaration of creating, by being a creator while at the same time he is checked  by irrevocable laws set by the nature of the material, not by man. Free experimentation here can result in t. he fulfillment of an inner urge to give form and to give permanence to ideas, that is to say, it can result in art, or it can result in the satisfaction of invention in some more technical way.    But most important to one's own growth is to see oneself leave the safe ground of accepted conventions and to find oneself alone and self-dependent. It is an adventure which can permeate one's whole  being. Self-confidence can grow. And a longing for excitement can be satisfied without external means, within oneself; for creating is the most intense excitement one can come to know.    All art work, such as music, architecture, and even religion and the laws of science, can be understood as the transformed wish for sta­bility and order. But art work understood as work with a substance  which can be grasped and formed is more suited for the develop­ment of the taste for exploration than work in other fields, for the fact of the inherent laws of material is of importance. They intro­duce boundaries for a task of free imagination. This very freedom  can be so bewildering to the searching person that it may lead to resignation if he is faced with the immense welter of possibilities; but within set limits the imagination can find something to hold to.  There still remains a fullness of choice but one not as overwhelming as that offered by unlimited opportunities. These boundaries may  be conceived as the skeleton of a structure. To the beginners a mate­rial with very definite limitations can for this reason he most helpful in the process of building up independent work.    The crafts, understood as conventions of treating material, introduce another factor: traditions of operation which embody set laws. This may be helpful in one direction, as a frame for work. But these  rules may also evoke a challenge. They are revokable, for they are set by man. They may provoke us to test ourselves against them. But always they provide a discipline which balances the hubris of creative ecstasy.    All crafts are suited to this end, but some better than others. The more possibilities for attack the material offers in its appearance and in its constructional elements, the more it can call out imagina­tion  and productiveness. Weaving is an example of a craft which is many-sided. Besides surface qualities, such as rough and smooth, dull and shiny, hard and soft, it also includes color, and, as the dominating element, texture, which is the result of the construction of weaves. Like any craft it may end in producing useful objects, or it may rise to the level of art.    When teaching the crafts, in addition to the work of free exploring, both the useful and the artistic have to be considered. As we have said before, today only the first step in the process of producing things of need is left to free planning. No variation is possible when production is once taken up, assuming that today mass pro­duction  must necessarily include machine work. This means that  the teaching has to lead toward planning for industrial repetition, with emphasis on making models for industry. It also must attempt to evoke a consciousness of developments, and further perhaps a foreseeing of them. Hence the result of craft work, work done in  direct contact with the material, can come here to have a meaning to a far wider range of people than would be the case if they remained restricted to hand work only. And from the industrial standpoint, machine production will get a fresh impetus from taking up the results of intimate work with material.    The other aspect of craft work is concerned with art work, the realization of a hope for a lawful and enduring nature. Other elements, such as proportion, space relations, rhythm, predominate in these experiments, as they do in the other arts. No limitations other than the fiat of the material itself are set. More than an active process, it is a listening for the dictation of the material and a taking in of the laws of harmony. It is for this reason that we can find certitude in the belief that we are taking part in an eternal order.

This is the answer of genius which grows without school and even in spite of schooling. At the same time we know that he had a teacher and became a teacher.  Delacroix went further when he wrote in his diary: ""How happy I should have heen to learn as a painter that which drives the ordinary musician to despair."" He meant by this the study of har­mony and especially the ""pure logic"" of the fugue: ""which is the  basis of all reason and consistency in music.""  These two assertions are not contradictory. They merely emphasize different aspects of an artist's work: on the one hand the intuitive search for and discovery of form; on the other hand the knowledge and application of the fundamental laws of form. Thus all render­ing of form, in fact all creative work, moves between the two polarities: intuition and intellect, or possibly between subjectivity  and objectivity. Their relative importance continually varies and they always more or less overlap.  I do not wish to assert that the practice of art cannot he learned or taught. But we do know that appreciation and understanding of art can grow hoth through learning (the development of intuitive perception and discrimination) and through teaching (the handing on  of authoritative knowledge). And just as every person is endowed with all the physiological senses - even if in varying degrees hoth  in proportion and quality - likewise, I believe, every person has all the senses of the soul (e. g. sensitivity to tone, color, space),  though undouhtedly with still greater differences in degree.  It is of course natural for this reason, that the schools should at least begin the development of all incipient faculties. But going further, art is a province in which one finds all the problems of life reflected - not only the problems of form (e. g. proportion and balance) but also spiritual problems (e. g. of philosophy, of religion, of  sociology, of economy). For this reason art is an important and rich medium for general education and development.    2    If we must accept education as life and as preparation for life, we must relate all school work, including work in art, as closely as possible to modern prohlems. It is not enough to memorize his­torical interpretations and resthetic views of the past or merely to encourage a purely individualistic expression. We need not be afraid of losing the connection with tradition if we make the ele­ments of form the basis of our study. And this thorough foundation saves us from imitation and mannerisms, it develops independence, critical ahility, and discipline.    From his own experiences the student should first become aware of form problems in general, and thereby become clear as to his own real inclinations and abilities. In short, our art instruction attempts  first to teach the student to see in the widest sense: to open his eyes to the phenomena ahout him and, most important of all, to open to his own living, being, and doing. In this connection we consider class work in art studies necessary hecause of the common tasks and  mutual criticism.    We find this way more successful than starting, without previous study of fundamentals, on studies in special fields with purely indi­vidualistic corrections, depending on the taste of the teacher. At first every student should come in contact with the fundamental problems in as many branches of art as possihle, instead of begin­ning,  for example, with life painting or animal sculpture.  Many years' experience in teaching have shown that it was often only through experimenting with the elements in various distinct branches of art that students first recognized their real ahilities. As a consequence these students had to change their original plans. As  an instance, a student of painting discovered his real talent was for metal working. Our first concern is not to turn out artists. We re­gard our elementary art work primarily as a means of general train­ing for all students. For artistically gifted students it serves as a broad foundation for later special study.    We have three main disciplines in our art instruction: Drawing, Basic Design (Werklehre), and Color-Painting. These are supple­mented by exhihitions and discussions of old and modern art, of    3    handicraft and industrial products, of typographic and photo­graphic work. The exhibitions are used to point out special inten­tions (e. g. art related to nature or remote from nature; the so-called primitivism; monumental form, pure form; and realism or imita­tion), and conditions due to working material (e. g. wood form,  stone form, metal form; silver form in the Baroque, and gold in the Gothic). In addition collections of materials ( different woods, stones, metals, textiles, leathers, artificial materials), are shown. By excursions to handicraft and manufacturing plants we seek to de­velop  an understanding of the treatment of material and of working in general (both as , matters of technique and as social matters).    Drawing we regard as a graphic language. Just as in studying lan­guage it is most important to teach first the commonly understood usage of speech, in drawing , we begin with exact observation and pure representation. We cannot communicate graphically what we do not see. That which we see incorrectly we will report incorrectly. We recognize that although our optical vision is correct, our over­emphasis on the psychic vision often makes us see incorrectly. For  this reason we learn to test our seeing, and systematically study fore­shortening, overlapping as the main form problems of graphic ar­ticulation, and distinction between and the pronunciation of near­ness  and distance.    Drawing consists of a visual and of a manual act. For the visual act ( comparable with thinking which precedes speaking) one must learn to see form as a three- dimensional phenomenon. For the man­ual  act ( comparable with speaking) the hand must be sensitized to the direction of the will. With this in mind we begin drawing les­sons with general technical exercises: measuring, dividing, esti­mating;  rhythms of measure and form, disposing, modifications of form. At the same time we use the motor sense as an important corrective. It will be clear that we exclude expressive drawing as a beginning.  Experience shows that in young people this encourages artistic con­ceit but hardly results in a solid capability which alone can give the foundation and freedom for more personal work. For this reason our elementary drawing instruction IS a handicraft    4    instruction, strictly objective, unadorned through style or man­nerism.  As soon as capability in handicraft has been fully devel­oped, more individual work may follow. As artistic performance it will develop best afterwards and outside the school.    We repeat, our drawing is the study of objective representation.    In Basic Design (Werklehre) - design with material- we culti­vate particularly feeling for material and space. It stands in contrast to a pure manual training in various handicrafts, which only applies traditionally fixed methods of work. We do not aim at ""a little book­binding"", ""a little carpentry"", but rather a general constructive thinking, especially a building thinking, which must be the basis of every work with any material. Basic Design is a forming out of  material ( e. g. paper, cardboard, metal sheets, wire), which demon­strates the possibilities and. limits of materials. This method empha­sizes  learning, a personal experience, rather than teaching. And so it is important to make inventions and discoveries. The idea is not to copy a book or a table, but to attain a finger-tip feeling for ma­terial.  Therefore we work with as few tools as possible and prefer material that has been infrequently used, such as corrugated paper, wire, wire netting. With well-known materials we seek to find un­tried possibilities.  Basic Design deals mainly with two subjects, with matiere studies on the one hand and material studies on the other.     Matiere studies are concerned with the appearance, the surface (epidermis) of material. Here we distinguish structure, facture, texture. We classify the appearances according to optical and tactile perception. We represent them by drawing and other means. In combination exercises we examine the relationship of different sur­face qualities. Just as color reacts to and influences color - in con­trast or affinity - so one matiere influences another.    Material studies are concerned with the capacity of materials. We examine firmness, looseness, elasticity; extensibility and compres­sibility;  folding and bending - in short technical properties. These  studies in connection with the mathematical inherence of form result in construction exercises. With these we try to develop an     5    understanding and feeling for space, volume, dimension; for balance, static and dynamic; for positive and active, for negative and passive forms. We stress economy of form, that is the ratio of effort to effect.    Comparisons of various examples in architecture, sculpture, paint­ing, help to make clear the conceptions of proportion, function, constellation, and composition as well as those of construction and combination.  In short, Werklehre is a trammg in adaptibility in the whole field of construction and in constructive thinking in general. Although we do not actually make practical things, the Werklehre is not opposed to handicraft work but is its very foundation.    Color we consider first as working material and we study its quali­ties. Sound production comes before speech, tone before music. And so at first we study systematically the tonal possibilities of colors,  their relativity, their interaction and influence on each other, cold and warmth, light intensity, color intensity, physical and spatial effects. We practice translating color combinations into different intensities, and from colorful to colorless colors. We practice color  tone scales, color mixtures and interpenetrations. We study the most important color systems, not for the sake of science or to find the harmony of colors in a mechanical way, but to learn to see and feel color. To prepare for a disciplined use of color and to  prevent accident, brush, or paint- box from taking authorship.    Even after these fundamental studies that occupy half a year we are not in a hurry to make paintings. The studies that follow, from nature or model, are in principle concerned with the relationship  between color, form, and space. Serious painting demands serious study. Rembrandt, at the age of thirty, is said to have felt the need of twenty years of study for a certain color-space problem.    By making an extended study in the three provinces of form, material, and color, we provide a broad foundation for the widest variety of tasks and for later specialization. No problem of form  lies outside our field. Thus we do not cultivate dilettantism - just    6    something to do - ( Beschaeftigungstrieb) but develop the crea­tive, productive possibilities ( Gestaltungstrieb). Class instruction with common tasks and criticisms coming from the students and then from the teacher communicates understanding of different  ways of seeing and of representing, and diminishes the tendency to overestimate one's own work.    It will be clear that this method is meant for mature students. For teaching children we should use other methods.    Life is more important than school, the student and the learning more important than the teacher and the teaching. More lasting than having heard and read is to have seen and experienced. The  result of the work of a school is difficult to determine while the pupil is in school. The best proofs are the results in later life, not,  for example, student exhibitions. Therefore to us the act of draw­ing is more important than the graphical product; a color correctly seen and understood more important than a mediocre still-life. It is better to be really able to draw a signboard than to be content  with unfinished portraits.    Most of our students will not become artists. But if they know, for example, the capacities of color they are prepared not only for painting but also for the practical use of color in interiors, furni­ture, clothes. These examples also illustrate the need of an under­standing  of materials.  We are content if our studies of form achieve an understanding vision, clear conceptions, and a productive will.

There will be comprehensive color, painting,  Werklehre, drawing, photography, sculpture,  weaving, and stagecraft exhibits on display  throughout the week.  Publication considered  For some time the publication of artistic and  literary material produced by members of the  community, including past teachers and alumni  as well as the present College group, has been  considered of interest for presentation outside  the College.  This year a group of students and teachers  have been active in collecting this work and  organizing a magazine- type publication that  would contain photography, both _ as. artistic  expression and as a means of reproducing art  work, as well as fiction, poetry and articles.  Besides such work by the students there are  available for the first issue a speech delivered  recently by Dr Gropius regarding the new  buildings for Lake Eden, and an article by Dr  Jalowetz on Schoenberg and His Time.  Should a method of financing the publication  be worked out, the magazine is planned for  distribution around the first of May. There will  be no definite future publication schedule, but  the magazine will be printed occasionally as  the quality and quantity of the available work  demands.  Resignation of Mr Rice  To a general meeting on Monday, March 4, the  Rector on behalf of the Board of Fellows an­nolmced  the resignation · . from the College of  J A Rice, which will become effective at the  end of this academic year. In the meeting Mr  Wunsch made the following statement: "" In  order that he may devote his full time to writ­ing  Mr Rice requested that the Board consider  his resignation. He told me that he is very  happy with his writing, and he hopes to devote  most of the rest of his life to it."" Mr Rice was  the leading person in the founding of the Col­lege,  and he served as Rector for four years.  During his sahatical leave this year he has heen  working on his book which he finds will take  much longer than he expected. The May issue  of Harper's Magazine will carry the second  chapter of the book, and Mr Rice expects to  have it completed early in 1941.  Two dramatic productions  The initial performance of Ah, Wilderness!,  the first of the two dramatic productions to  be given this spring, will be on April 25. It  will be repeated on May 3 for the Guest Days.  Macbeth will be presented on May 7, and after  the Guest Days will be taken to Cullowhee and  Lenoir, N C  Lisa J alowetz, former student of the Max  Reinhardt School in Vienna, has designed the  settings and costumes for the O'Neill comedy.  Stylization of the early twentieth century decors  is the keynote of the designs.  The cast of Ah, Wilderness! includes a large  number of new students, with some of the  major roles being portrayed by students who  have never done drama work at the College  before.  It is planned that Macbeth will be presented in  J; he College gymnasium where a single archi­tectural  set that may be used throughout the  entire play will be constructed. Because the  settings will be in black, gray, and brown, color  and brightness will be provided by the cos­tumes,  lights, and properties. No proscenium  arch will be used, and blackouts will divide  the scenes.  John Stix and Sue Spayth, two students whose  major work at the College is in the drama and  who worked in the leading roles of John  Gabriel Borkman last term, have been cast as  Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.  News briefs  Kirill Chenkin, a graduate of the  University of Paris with a degree  of Licencie es Lettres, has been  appointed Assistant Instructor in  French. Following the completion of  his university work Mr Chenkin  served for two years in the Inter ·  national Brigade with the Republi­can  Forces in Spain. He was born in  Petrograd ( now Leningrad), and has  lived in Paris since 1925. The work  for his degree was done in com­parative  literature with special em­phasis  on the literature of France  and Russia.  Rachel Dwinell, of Montpelier, Ver­mont,  has been appointed to the  office staff. Miss Dwinell is a grad­uate  of Elmira College as a Social  Science major. Previous to coming  to Black Mountain she was college  secretary of the YWCA, house moth­er  in a small orphanage, office work ­er  for the Women's International  League, and a field worker in the  National Council for the Prevention  of War.  Mr Alhers. visited Berea College in  Kentucky recently where he spoke  to students and teachers on the  meaning and teaching of art. Previ­0usly  he had spoken on abstract art  at the Mint Museum of Art in Char­lotte  where some of his paintings  were included in an exhibit with  works of Lyonel Feininger and Frank  London.  The candidates for graduation this  year are: Richard Andrews, Bela  Martin, Alexander Reed and Hope  Stephens, all in the field of art.  Marcel Breuer, associate of Walter  Gropius and co- designer of the pro ·  jected buildings for Lake Eden, has  been secured as the outside examiner.  During the first part of April Mr  Albers will conduct a series of semi­nars  in Design at Harvard. He will  also speak at the Museum School of  Art in Boston on "" Problems of De ·  sign,"" and will talk on "" The Rela­tionships  Between Material and  Form"" at the Phillips Exeter Acad­emy.  Mr Wunsch will speak to the college  conference of the Western Arts As­sociation  in Cincinnati on April 18.  Mr Wunsch will be one of the dem­onstration  college teachers at the  University of Chicago workshop this  summer where he will conduct class ·  es in contemporary literature and in  creative writing. He recently attend­ed  the national conference of the  Progressive Education Association in  Chicago where he addrcssed the dra ·  matics directors on "" Dramatic Living  Through Dramatic Projects."" Mr  Wunsch has been named consultant  of literature and drama in a new  type of field service developed by  the Progressive Education Associa­tion.

While the immediate and future need of educated citizens is more imperative than ever, the present demand for practical effectiveness and speed is also ohvious. The accelerated program descrihed helow makes graduation possible in three years or less; students are to he encouraged to enter at as  young an age as is feasible; new courses both academic and prac­tical provide training for immediate needs; and continued emphasis on a democratic way of life and on physical development build the moral and physical stamina so essential to these times and to all  times.    While adapting itself to the war effort the College retains the basic function of higher education as its major ohjective: training in thoughtful action, transmission and enhancement of our cultural  heritage, and development of a consciousness of those principles for which we are now struggling. The enormous social, economic, po­litical, and ethical prohlems that the war brings with it - and which  the peace will render even more colossal- can he solved only through the application of deep understanding, imaginative intelligence, and true conviction. Education must prepare youth, young women as well as young men, to deal with these problems, to solve  them. Wisdom cannot he improvised; good judgment requires a seasoned mind and disciplined feelings.    ENLISTED RESERVE CORPS  Black Mountain College has heen assigned a quota in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps and the Air Corps Enlisted Reserve. The purpose of the AERC and the ACER is to provide a future supply of officer candidates for the United States Army. To this end, prop­erly  qualified college students are encouraged to finish their college    2    education and are deferred from military service to do so. Incoming first year students will be eligible to apply for such enlistment. In addition to the fundamental courses available in mathematics and the physical sciences, such students can take courses in the liberal  arts and sciences. Black Mountain will co-operate with the new government plan for 18- 19 year old students, when adopted.    EXTENSION OF CURRICULUM  New courses of particular relevancy to the present situation are being introduced. Some of these are immediately practical- such as surveying, first aid, photography; others - such as inter-American  affairs, Oriental history, and Russian - comprise only a pertinent expansion of the liberal arts curriculum. The student's main pur­pose, however, is to achieve a solid general education embodying the indispensable values of clear thinking, discipline, method, imagi­nation,  will and character.    WORK- EXPERIENCE PROGRAM  In response to present demands there is considerable emphasis upon farm work this year in the work program. However, experience leading to the acquirement of skills in building and construction  and related to studies in architecture is obtainable through activi­ties in connection with necessary maintenance and repair. Once a student's personal responsibility is established, leadership is devel­oped  through opportunities to direct individual projects which  range from harvesting to operating the College Bookstore. These projects are open to men and women equally. An important element in such work is the development of physical fitness. Members of the  community now devote an average of three or four afternoons per week to this program.    ACCELERATED PROGRAM  Heretofore the College has been in session thirty- two weeks each year. Beginning June 22, 1942, it will be open for four quarters of eleven weeks each. Under this plan students may come for either three or four quarters each year, but because of the war emergency  they are encouraged to attend four quarters and hasten their gradu­ation. Students, as heretofore, will continue to graduate when they are prepared to do so, the average time being at the end of twelve quarters.    3    ADMISSION TO THE STUDENT BODY  The College has never had fixed regulations concerning the age or scholastic background of applicants for admission, since it has pre­ferred to consider each individual case upon its merits. Although most applicants are of usual college age and have completed a four­-year course in accredited secondary schools, younger students, or students who have not finished secondary school, have been ad­mitted when their records indicated that they could carry college work. Almost without exception such students have proved to be ready for college. In the present emergency the College will en­courage students of this kind to apply, provided their secondary school principals or headmasters recommend them for college en­trance  before graduation. Although the College knows that genuine education cannot be accelerated beyond a certain point, it does be­lieve that those who can proceed rapidly should be given the oppor­tunity to do so.    WAR TIME SCHOLARSHIPS  In addition to the reductions in fee mentioned below, the College is offering as its contribution to war- time education seventeen Re­duced Fee Scholarships, ranging from $750 to $200. Ten of these are for men and seven for women. To make these scholarships avail­able, the fund for fee reductions in 1942-43 has been increased to $46,000, $11,00 more than the $35,000 allotted for this purpose in 1941-42. They may be awarded to students entering during anyone of the following quarters: Winter, Spring, or Summer of 1943. At  the time of application they must file a confidential statement at­testing their financial need for the amount of scholarship for which they apply. Candidates will be judged upon their academic achieve­ment, character, personality, manual and artistic skills.    FEES FOR THE YEAR  Believing that a cross-section of American life, economic as well as geographical, is intrinsic to the idea of the College, and realizing that a student's ability to pay the full cost of his education is in no sense a criterion of his desirability, the College makes use of a  sliding scale in its yearly fee. This scale ranges, according to ability to pay, from $1200 to $450 for room, board, and tuition, for the normal academic year of three quarters. In so far as possible, ad­mission  to the student body is made to depend upon personal merit. The Admissions Committee decides on each applicant, in the first instance, quite independently of financial considerations. Unfortu­nately, lack of endowment and limited resources do not permit as  full an expression of this principle as is ultimately desired, since a    4    certain gross income from student fees must he maintained in order to meet the operating expenses of the College. Nevertheless, during the academic year 1941-1942, over $35,000 in fee reductions was  granted.    Those who can are required to hear the full cost of their education, and to pay the full yearly fee of $1200 for the academic year of three quarters. Others pay as much of this fee as they can afford, the deficiency being partially made up from gifts to the College. Since there are more applicants for admission than can be accepted,  and since many of these need a large reduction of fee, the competition is, of course, greatest at the lower fee levels, particularly at the minimum fee of $450.    Within the College money is minimized as a basis for the measure­ment of the individual. No distinction of any kind is made between students paying reduced fees and those paying the full fee, the amount paid by each student being known only to a small financial committee, unless the student himself chooses to reveal it. No pro­vision is made for students to work their way through the College, for the extra-curricular work done by students is regarded as educational activity and is on a voluntary basis with no reference to their financial status.    There are available a few tuition scholarships whereby a limited number of exceptional students who cannot pay the minimum fee are enabled to attend college for less than $450 a year. As vacancies occur in these scholarships, and as new ones are created, awards will  be made to entering students, on a basis of merit as determined by the Admissions Committee. Some financial assistance, also, is available from a small Student Loan Fund to students who have attended  the College for at least three quarters and whose resources have un­expectedly changed. With the exception of the loans described below in connection with the accelerated program, applicants for  admission should have in sight sufficient funds for the total length of time that they expect to attend the College, since in general they will not be eligible to borrow from the fund unless unforeseeable and authentic changes have occurred in their finances. Such loans as are made must be secured by notes signed by the student and endorsed by his parents or guardian. The College believes that a student should rarely borrow, from all sources, more than ahout  $1800 for his education; and that all borrowing should be under such conditions of repayment that the debt contracted will not be too onerous a burden after graduation.    Applicants paying the full fee must submit with their Application for Admission a signed Financial Agreement, and a new Agreement must be signed every year that they remain in College.    5    Applicants' for a reduction of fee are required annually to make a detailed confidential statement of their families' financial resources on a blank furnished by the College. This statement must be signed by the person responsible for the payment of fees. From the infor­mation submitted, the Committee on Student Fees sets what it be­lieves to be a fair fee, taking into account not only the individual circumstances of each case but also the comparative circumstances of all cases. Only in this way can a reasonable equity be maintained. Although fees may vary from year to year depending upon the re­sources of the applicants' families, it is generally expected that the initial fee set will be either maintained or increased in subsequent years when initial expenses do not recur. Because of rising costs the College may find it unavoidable, in the future, to raise all reduced  fees by some percentage. After a reduced fee bas been agreed upon, a Financial Agreement embodying it will be sent for signature to the person responsible for fees; a new Agreement must be signed each year.    No student may enter or remain in: residence while any financial arrangements are pending. All fees will be set on the basis of an academic year of three quar­ters.  Students who follow the accelerated program, attending four quarters in one year, will be charged in addition one third of the fee paid for three quarters. Although it is understood ihat this arrangement may work a temporary hardship on some people, and even prevent others from following the accelerated program, the  College has no alternative since its income is largely derived from student fees. At their present average level these do not meet edu­cational costs. Thus the total fees for twelve quarters will be the same whether they are spread over three years or four. It may be  pointed out, however, that a year's personal expenses will be saved by following the accelerated program. It is anticipated that in many cases the additional expense for a fourth quarter will have to be met by borrowing. In such cases the College will co- operate by sug­gesting  possible sources of help where such are known and, in a  very limited number of instances may be able to lend up to one half of the additional fee for a fourth quarter taken within any given twelve-month period. Such loans would be repaid during what would otherwise have been the fourth year of the student's attendance at College. Loans for the fourth quarter may be applied for after two  quarters of residence.    For personal expenses students need per quarter at least $20 to $30, exclusive of transportation.    PAYMENTS OF FEES  The College will guarantee the reservation of a place in the student    6    body upon a deposit of $200.00 payable upon notification of admission. This deposit is not refundable if for any reason withdrawal occurs later than thiry days prior  to proposed entrance date, since such withdrawal may create a vacancy with otherwise would have been filled. This deposit is credited to the year's account of the entering student.     The yearly fee is payable as follows:  Full Fee Reduced Fee  Deposit upon notice of admission $200.00 $200.00  On entrance $400.00 Two-fifths of the balance  Opening date of next quarter $400.00 Two-fifths of the balance  Opening date of third quarter $200.00 The balance    If a student attends all four quarters in a given year, the extra fee for the fourth quarter is due as follows: one half of fee for this quarter thirty days prior to opening date of quarter; balance on opening date of quarter.    For students entering more than three weeks after a quarter has begun special adjustments will be made.    The only other fees are:  Application fee $5.00  Contingency deposit $25.00  Examination for graduation $25.00  Fee for late payment of any bill $10.00    The application fee must accompany application for admission to the College and is not refundable. The contingency deposit of $25.00 is payable upon entrance. While a student is in attendance it must be maintained, but any unused portion of it is refunded upon grad­uation  or withdrawal. Bills are payable on the date of the bill and I if not paid within ten days are subject to the fee for late payment.    In cases where students are called into military service charges are made on an exact pro rata basis only for the time they have attended. Any amount in excess of this that has been paid is refunded. All future tuition payments although contracted for are of course  canceled.     7    ADVISORY COUNCIL  Arthur S. Adams  Ithaca New York  Francis F. Bradshaw Chapel Hill North Carolina  John E.

In a panel  of students and faculty members,  Dr Buchanan opened the seminar  with the question, "" Was Oedipus  happy?"" which developed into an  investigation of the nature of tra­gedy,  the question of determinism  in the play, and the problem of hu­man  suffering. Comparisons were  drawn between Greek and Shake­spearean  tragedy in an attempt to  find a common denominator for all  tragedy. Later the discussion was  opened to the audience, which in­cluded  both community members  and guests.  At informal meetings on the follow­ing  day Dr Buchanan outlined some  of. the principles and beliefs on  which St John's is based, and the  similarities and differences between  St John's and Black Mountain were  discussed. Both colleges feel the  generally accepted tendencies of  modern education to be wrong, but  the remedies they offer differ in  many ways. The summary of the  discussion here printed must be  read with the understanding that it  is the view of Black Mountain peo­ple,  and that it attempts to compress  -- and therefore to over- simplify­the  arguments on both sides.  What appeared in the discussion as  a basic difference was the concept  of man held by each college. St  John's considers that, for purposes  of educa tion, man must be 100keJ  at as a rational being. Black Moun­tain  believes that man is a thinking  being. In line with its concept, St  John's trains the mind, seein!! the  intellect as the whole educable"" man.  Black Mountain, seeing man as a  social being with the important at­tribute  of thinking, is concerned  with character, behaviour, social  adjustment, "" emotional maturity,""  as well as with purely academic  training. St John's develops its phil­osophy  into a teaching method  which emphasizes the reading of  great books, the seminar discussion,  the formal lecture. Black M'Ol1Jlt: ain  works out a plan in which conimu-'  nity living, physical labor, and work&lt;  in the arts take their place beside  class work. St John's follows a pre­sGribed  curriculum from which little  deviation is allowed, for it helieves  that questions wiII arise with suffi­cient  uniformity and regularity so  that a fixed curriculum will gener­ally  provide the answers. ' Black  Mountain believes that questions  arise at different times, from dif­ferent  causes, and through different  avenues, and that answers cannot  he meaningful nntil questions arise.  The curriculum, therefore, must he  elective in order to achieve a flex­ible  working halance hetween the  Number 12 March 1941  interests of the student and the re­sistances  of the subject matter.  Some time was spent talking about  the different interpretations of free­dom  at the two colleges. Dr Buch­anan  believes that the apparent  freedom of Black Mountain has lit­tle  value as part of education. 5t  John's, he lIays, emphasi? es the im­portance  of inner freedom which  unlike political or economic free:  dom, cannot be taken away once it  becomes a part of the individual.  But Black Mountain is unwilling to  view its freedom as such a super­ficial  thing; it considers it as in­~  aluabl~ to the development of any  Inner freedom, as a necessary part  of the experiment in community  living, and as a means to fuller edu­cational  opportunity for its students.  Education must be regarded in the  final analysis as preparation for liv­ing.  To meet the accusation that 5t  John's is neglecting the problems of  the world and withdrawinO"" into the  security of the past, Dr Buchanan  maintained that 5t John's students  are studying the permanent, the  monumental, the perennial wisdom  of mankind. But is such a study all  of education? Can the reading of  philosophies uncorrelated with the  dcvelopment of the individual be  useful in living in and helping in  the development of the modern  world? Can the study of mathe­matics,  which Dr Buchanan men­tioned  as being the most highly im­a~  inative part of the curriculum,  stImulate increased awareness in  all fields? And is an exclusively in­tellectual  education the best way to  prepare for emotional crises, for  the intensity of modern livinO"" for  ~ he solution of personal problems  In a mature way?  An intensified interest in educa­tional  problems in general, and in  the particular place of Black Moun­tain  College in the educational  world, has been created by Dr Buch­anan's  visit. Such an interest, and  the discussions; organized and  otherwise, which came after he left  point out another difference be:  tween the two colleges. 5t John's  feels it has found an answer to what  it calls "" the crisis in liberal educa­tion.""  It has crystalized its ideas  into patterns which it believes to be  good, which it hopes may prove per­manent.  Black Mountain has not. It  continually reviews its practices and  the principles on which they ar.~  based, re- evaluates, examines and  re- examines them. 5t John's is seek­ing  for permanent forms in a world  it sees as basically permanent;  Black Mountain recognizes a moy­ing  world and the necessity and in­evitability  of finding new forms to  express basic permanence in ac­cordance  with historical change.  Fernand Leger  Another February visitor at the Col­lege  was Fernand Leger, famous  French artist.  Through an interpreter M Leger  talked to the community on the re­lation  of painting to architecture  describing the effects of various co:  lor t. reatments on walls, ceiling, and  furmture. He believes that the pur­pose  of color in architecture is to  destroy the sense of enclosure nor­mally  resulting from four walls.  This opening out of a room may be  achieved by getting away from con­vention  and painting the walls dif­ferent  colors, by breakinO"" up larO"" e  wall areas with strongly ~ ontrasti~ o'  colors, by using colors which seer:;.  to come forward or to recede from  the eye. A powerful picture will  also help in bringing a room to life;  M Leger says, "" A paintinO"" is the  antithesis of a wall."" ""  In his lecture and later in classroom  discussions and individual confer­ences,  M Leger emphasized the  value of contrast as an artistic ele­ment.  Contrast in form as well as in  color implies reality and truth, he  said, "" for ' Truth' in painting is  color at its fullest: red, black, yel­low,  since the pure tone in painting  is reality. Also it is the use of pic­tural  contrasts, the design that re­inforces  color, the form ( objective  or invented) which together with  color and design creates an equiva­lent  of the"" real."" People are afraid  of such truth, he said. "" Education,  religion, the ' decorative life' are  three inventions, three envelopes  created to conceal truth."" He dis­likes  art that is purely decorative,  that is designed to harmonize with  everything, to fuse itself with every­thing,  to be restful, "" the art of re­pose.""  Leger IS rated by art critics with  Picasso and Mil'o as one of the most  important of the modernists. Dur­ing  the Spanish war he worked for  the Loyalists, giving exhibitions the  proceeds of which were used to aid  Spanish democracy.  He escaped from France just before  the German invasion, going first to  Bordeaux, which he was later  forced to leave. His only asset when  he arrived in this country was his  ability to paint; he had almost no  money, and only the clothes he had  on his back. In the United States he  has been painting and lecturing.  His family is still in France, living  at his farmhouse in occupied Nor­mandy;  at present he has little hope  of being able to help them.  His work has recently been ex­hibited  at the Marie Harriman gal­leries  in New York; other exhibi­tions  are planned.  Work program  The work program this spring in­cludes  thl'ee major projects: the  completion of the new building, the  remodelling of the cottages and  lodges already on the property, and  the development of the farm.  The shell of the new hnilding is  complete with the exception [' f the  stair tower which, because of its  stone and concrete construction,  could not be finished during cold  weather. However, work on thc  walls is again going forward and one  of the three concrete floors has becn  poured.  Glazing of the steel window fralllcs  and wiring of the studies have  begun. The use of a usually expen­sive  type of recessed ceiling light in  the studies has been made possihle  because a large part of the work in­volved  in the installation can"" be  done by students. The floors in the  main part of the building will he of  oak from trees now being cut on  the Lake Eden property.  Plans for the heating of the build­ing  have been worked on during the  winter, and the contract will be  signed before the spring vacation.  The plant will require a furnace  room and chimney stack, both ont­side  the area of the first building.  The chimney, as"" proposed, will be  of reinforced concrete, and almost  seventy- five feet high. This sizcis  required to take care of future addi­tions  to the building group. Studies  will have concealed radiators of the  convector type, with only a register  face visible in each room.  The old Lake Eden buildings are  being renovated for use next year  as dormitories, college offices, fac­ulty  homes, and library. Walls are  being insulated, additional wiring  installed, and excavations for fur­nace  rooms are being made under  each cottage. This work will pro­bably  continue until mid- summer or  early fall.  Students and faculty are assisting  Mr Penley, the farm manager, in  clearing land, ploughing, and fence  building, as part of the plan to  make the farm economically more  valuable to the College.  The work program will be con­tinued  during the spring vacation  ( March 23- 30) by members of the  community who are remaining at  the College.  Faculty activjties  Robert Babcock, professor of Po­litical  Science, recently returned  from a two week trip, during which  he visited secondary schools in New  York City, Connecticut, and New  Jersey.  Theodore Dreier left on March 11  for a three week trip to Washing­ton,  New York, Boston, and pos­sibly  Pittsburgh and St Louis. His  time will be spent in trying to raise  funds necessary for the completion  of the new building.  Nathan Rosen, professor of Physics,  recently visited Chapel Hill, Prince­ton,  and Massachusetts Institute of  Technology · in connection with the  research work he is doing in col­laboration  with Charles Lindsley,  professor of Chemistry. While at  Chapel Hill, Mr Rosen gave a talk  before the joint physics colloquium  of Duke University and the Univer­sity  of North Carolina on "" The Par­ticle  in Wave Mechanics.""  Earlier in the term Dr Straus visited  St John's College in Annapolis,  Maryland, where he lectured on  "" The Essential Characteristics of  Psychological Knowledge,"" and con­ducted  a seminar on "" Sound and  Hearing, and Their Relation to  Physics, Physiology, and Psycho­logy.  Visitors week-- April 25- 28  Dr Gilbert Chinard, Pyne Professor  of French Literature at Princeton  University, has accepted the invita­tion  of the College to be guest  speaker on l\ fonday, April 28. Dr  Chinard came to this country from  Fl: ance some twenty years ago to  study the influence of French colon­ization  on American history and rc­mained  to continue his research as  a resident of the United States. He  had previously studied at the Col­lege  de Chatelleraut, Lycee de Poi­tiers,  Universite de Bordeaux and  the Sorbonne. In this country he  has held teaching posts in the fields  of French and French literature at  the College of the City of New  York, Brown University, the Uni­versity  of California, Johns Hopkins  University, and the University of  Chicago. In 1937 he was appointed  to the faculty of Princeton Univer­sity  where he conducts courses in  Franco- American and Anglo- French  Cultural Relations. He is a member  of the Modern Language Association  of America, the American Philo­sophical  Society, and many other  professional organizations. Many of  his writings have been publislred in.. J  this country and in France.  Because of ill health it was neces­sary  for Lewis Mumford to cancel  his engagement as guest lecturer as  announced in the last issue of the  Newsletter.

It is also a functioning community. Several important fea­tures distinguish it from the conventional American college, while  at the same time it pursues the essential aims of liberal arts insti­tutions.    One main difference is that the fine arts are equated as a field of study with the sciences, languages and literatures, and the social sciences. Students are expected to qualify in all these four fields before they are permitted to specialize in one. Most colleges offer­ing the B. A. or its equivalent require some work in a science, but few require experience in the arts. The arts offered at Black Moun­tain are music, painting, drama and dancing, work with material, architecture, and weaving. These are studied in their theoretical  and historical aspects as well as from the point of view of craft. But their larger contribution to a student's education is that the arts, like literature, social studies, or the sciences when widely con­ceived, are treated as a focus for many aspects of life. Hence they become a discipline equal in scope and significance with the three  conventional divisions of the curriculum. There are other media of communication than words or mathematical formulae, and other repositories of human experience than books. It is the function of the teacher of an art to enliven the student's understanding in his particular medium, to the end that he will not only see and appreciate but perhaps learn to use this medium to some small degree for his own communication and expression. The aim is not so much to produce artists as to develop an understanding of the worlds and the languages with which the various arts have to do.    Many American college students sing or play instruments, but they are not often encouraged tg play the world's great music as a natural pastime or to enjoy it in informal concerts as a normal form of entertainment. Acting, writing, and even painting are not unknown to the American undergraduate, but usually these activities have a marginal position in collegiate life; they are extra-curricular, or are studied in courses attended primarily by the special student, or  they are cultivated by cliques of self-conscious individuals who flatter their own egos and are mildly contemned by the more virile, sociable, and intellectual. Under these circumstances the arts as a subject for serious and general study do not flourish in most colleges. At Black Mountain, however, they take their more proper place as one of the primary means of expression. Faculty and stu­dents, many of whom have no special training in the arts, partici­pate in community plays, concerts, drawing and designing classes,  and building. There is constant artistic activity of various kinds which is a normal part of the community life and in which almost everyone participates in one way or another.    A second divergence from conventional college life is the inclusion of a work program as a part of education. All take part in this, irrespective of the tuition fee they pay (the college fee is based on a sliding scale, the individual paying according to his financial resources). The college is unendowed and hence forced to live  frugally on its income from student fees and occasional gifts. Out of this necessity rose certain educational possibilities which have developed into principles. Everyone is expected to help with the work of the community: building the necessary college buildings  under the supervision of an architect, landscaping the grounds, helping run a farm which produces a considerable amount of the food of the community, maintaining roads and buildings, construct­ing  stage sets, helping in the college offices. In this work students learn to handle tools and simple machinery; they become acquainted with some of the basic routines of the world's work and with the life of the worker. By the end of their four years some may even become fairly competent craftsmen. But more important is  the fact that they live in a simple yet representative American community which is engaged in a variety of the practical activities of daily modern life. In seeking to maintain a smoothly operating and productive plant, which they feel belongs to them and provides  the means for their education, the students come to know real responsibility.    A third aspect of the college distinguishes it from most colleges, and like the first two mentioned may offer a suggestion for future developments in American institutions. I refer to real self-government.    The college is estahlished on its own property and, being neither tax supported nor endowed, is independent of a board of trustees or other external controlling groups. It derives its income largely  from student fees. Hence it is free to act according to its own decisions. The faculty as a body own and have the ultimate control of the college property and educational discipline. They elect from their membership a board of fellows which administers the finances and makes faculty appointments. The board is considered  to be an executive committee of the faculty. This means real self­-government for a college faculty.    Community Self-Government  The students participate in this community self-government. Their four officers attend faculty meetings dealing with the general affairs of the college. The chief student officer, the moderator, is a legal member of the board of fellows during his period of office. As  such he has full voting power and an equal voice with the other eight members. Needless to say, this is a grave responsibility for a student, since his vote may have a decided weight in making an appointment to the faculty or in determining financial policy which  affects the whole community.     Community problems are brought to the general community meet­ings for discussion and in so far as possible for settlement. These meetings, attended by all members of the staff, their families, and the students, are in character much like the New England town  meeting. Anyone who feels he has something that should be said is expected to speak, and his words are weighed according to their worth, not according to the age or reputation of the speaker.Decisions are based on a consensus of opinion.    Aims of Education  The foregoing remarks should give some idea of the meaning of the stated aim of the college: to educate a student as a person and as a citizen. There are certain broad areas in human experience: the intellectual, the esthetic, the practical, the social and political, the  religious. In most American colleges all but the first of these are generally ignored. Undoubtedly the intellectual education of a stu­dent is of major importance; and unfortunately even that takes  longer than a brief four years, following a somewhat inadequate high school background, will permit. But a wider training is necessary today. In a college where the life approximates that of a normal community (in the variety of practical activities, and in the  interdependence of associates of different ages and backgrounds, ranging from faculty children to elderly people and students from abroad), a student gets much basic social and political experience from the life itself, and this is of great importance in the education  of citizens in these times.    This ease of communication between faculty and student is not an educational ideal imposed on principle. It is inherent in the life of the college community, where students and faculty eat together in a common dining room and share the work of serving themselves.  According to their abilities they participate together in concerts, plays, and radio programs, in sawing wood for the community furnaces, entePtaining college guests, interviewing prospective stu­dents, helping to raise money to meet deficits, and in the thousand  and one tasks incidental to running the college. Living and studying are thus two aspects of one unified educational, process.    I do not suggest - it would be too naive - that varied experiences in themselves educate in the higher sense. Life gives such oppor­tunities to most people, and it is the business of a liberal arts col­lege to render a student ""expert beyond experience."" As Roger  Ascham said long ago: ""Learning teacheth more in one year than experience in twenty...he hazardeth sore that waxeth wise by ex­perience."" I am speaking rather of the cumulative effect of con­stant association between teacher and student at all levels of ex­perience,  in and out of the classroom, in situations where knowledge and wisdom furnish a ready answer, and in situations where they do not. Undergraduates are largely influenced by the personalities with whom they have the most immediate and prolonged association. Generally these are members of a fraternity or sorority.  Most American students live in a world which is quite different from the normal adult world. They associate almost wholly for four years with people of their own age group, often only of their own sex, and very often only of their own interests. At graduation they are suddenly precipitated into a new kind of life, of business,  conflict and competition, worry and responsibility, where the things they have studied seem to have little application. Black Mountain College tries to prepare students for life by carrying on learning in an environment of normal human activities. It offers something like adult education, in a community where the main emphasis is upon study hut where the work of the world plays an active role.    The road to self-discipline, maturity, and competence is long and hard. The kind of education Black Mountain attempts is not an easy one. Of course the surest way to get efficiency in administer­ing a community would he to establish a permanent bureaucracy of  faculty members who knew the work and could despatch it quickly. Effective routines would be set up and conflicts avoided.    This, however, does not lead to maturity of judgment and action, or to civic responsihility in a tangled world where established forms and values are vanishing. We need citizens who have toughness of mind, a capacity for meeting the unexpected with clear eyes, and  a steadiness of purpose that is based on the sure knowledge derived from experience, understanding, and practical competence.    Academic Program  The aim of the college in the academic area is to give students a sound introduction to major subjects that lie in the four areas of the curriculum, and to develop sufficient grasp of a special field so that a student may be ahle to form independent judgments within  it. Work is divided into the junior and the senior divisions, each usually taking two years of the student's time. Completion of work in each division is determined by means of comprehensive exami­nations and faculty consideration of the individual student's progress.  In the junior division a student studies central suhjects in each of the four areas. These may vary somewhat according to his interests. He should gain sufficient knowledge in these areas so that he can  choose intelligently that special field in which he is most interested I and for which he has the most talent. There is no hierarchy of courses leading automatically to entrance into the senior division, and in this sense no courses are ""required."" However, the conl­prehensive examination for entrance into the senior division is a test of real knowledge, at an undergraduate level, in the four fields.    To prepare himself for this a student is encouraged to pursue his own reading as well as taking courses. The faculty assume the po­sition of guides and advisers. The student is made to feel that it is his responsibility to prepare himself for the examination, which he  may take whenever the faculty believe he is ready for it. A part of the duty of the faculty adviser is to help him to realize his accomplishments and his limitation in this respect. The exami­nation consists of two parts: a comprehensive test of knowledge and understanding in the four areas of study, and a group of ques­tions  to which they may be no answers but which test a student's judgment, observation, imagination, appreciation, and capacity to reach decisions. The faculty as a body study these papers thorough­ly  and review the applicant's maturity of conduct within the com­munity before passing him into the senior division and recommend­ing a particular field for special study.    Work in the senior division corresponds to the usual ""major"" in American colleges, though it may be somewhat more intensive and is usually done under tutorial guidance rather than in course work.  A student is epected by the time he graduates to be capable of independent work in his special field: to be familiar with its main areas and to be able to use the chief sources of information avail­able. He should also have his own method of working and be able  to form independent judgments based on first-hand acquaintance with the material of the subject. In the senior division the student is given considerable freedom of action under the guidance of his  major instructor and adviser. The comprehensive examinations for graduation, consisting of from five to seven three-hour papers and a public oral examination, are given by authorities in the field from outside the college. It is assumed that the work done will he  at least equal to that required for graduation in particular field at the better American colleges and universities.    Black Mountain College aims to educate persons as well as minds. Life in a community, with its attendant work and the social aware­ness and competences derived therefrom, and the development of esthetic sensibilities that enrich individual living, are regarded as  parts of that education. Direct experience of the democratic pro­cesses and of some of the common tasks of the world, in a context of intensive liberal arts study, seem to the faculty of this college to provide one significant way to educate American citizens.

During those years most people believed that in western civilization man had reached a more or less definitive state of historical develop­ment. In accordance with this attitude the past was interpreted in a somewhat peculiar way.    We had heard about wars, about persecution, about intolerance; we had heard about terrible ignorance and its dreadful consequences; we had heard about sinister superstitions, persecution of witches, social injustices, the pride and arrogance of the mighty, corrupt  courts, torture, and whatnot. But we also had learned that since 1600, or somewhat earlier, when man's eyes were opened, there had been irresistible progress. We became infinitely tolerant. We were inclined to pardon even before we understood. The ""Dark Ages"", thank heaven, were gone!    There was general optimism and a feeling of security. And then suddenly that shocking disappointment to optimism and security! Suddenly history with all its good and had passions was alive again. Suddenly everything which we thought gone forever was here again,  and that progressive state which we expected to be the final and lasting one had disappeared.    Today the ominous symptoms of still greater changes are showing themselves. All the principles on which the social order of the nineteenth century were laid are challenged. They have become suspect; even the longing for security has itself become suspect. There is a dissolution of the old order, but only vague signs of the  new one. It is a time of lasting and continuous crises.    The younger generation reacts in its own way. It is distrustful- the young people do not want to be betrayed by solemn words used by the church, the state, thc social leaders, the universities. Did not Nietzsche and Freud teach us what is hidden behind such words?  Should we not be aware of conscious or unconscious hypocrisy? Are these words not the weapons of the weak?    What can be done under these circumstances? What can the older generation do for the younger one? What can education in such a time of crisis mean and do? There are many opinions and proposals held by different groups. Some of the more important of these may be outlined:    The first group - a large one - is composed of people who believe that all of this unrest was caused hy a few wicked individuals, whom they even call criminals and gangsters. According to their back-ground, their education, their nationality, their economic condi­tions,  their temperament, these people make this man or that man the scapegoat. By imposing all responsibility and guilt upon a single person, they obscure their vision of the fact that the causes and effects of this crisis are much more powerful; that the crisis is more widespread. There are no oceans between it and us. People belonging to this group believe that if only Stalin or Mussolini or Hitler or Roosevelt were made harmless, peace in the political world, peace in the social and economic world, and peace within their hearts would automatically return. Since they take political  measures as the only remedy for the crisis, we may call them by a friendly name, ""political critics,"" and by an unfriendly name, ""the superficial."" They can have no pedagogical theories of their own.    The second group - irritated, annoyed, and disgusted by the his­torical development just as the first one - has a completely negative attitude. People in this group consider the social and political order into which they were born as the only one; that is, the only just  one and the only right one. Everything should remain as it has always been ( by ""always"" they mean for the last fifty to one hun­dred years). They look at the past as the prologue to their own time. Now, as the historical development has been fulfilled, history should come to a standstill. The future should be but a repetition  and a continuation of the present. They expect to overcome the threatening dangers by holding fast to old forms, by giving many and detailed prescriptions which can be easily enforced. They over­look the fact that the internal order and philosophy of life is the condition of the external order; that the external order hecomes  morihund if the internal one dies away. The struggle for freedom, and the political, religious, and scientific martyrs, prove that the policeman and even the hangman cannot guard against change. Be­cause  these people put all hope in tradition, one may call them.  using a friendly name, ""conservatives."" And opponents may call them, ""reactionaries."" Their pedagogical theory calls for many and strict rules, for many examinations and requirements.    To the third group helong those who welcome the decline or hreak­down of the old order as the hreakdown of order as such. They believe that one has only to put aside the limitations and houndarie's set up by state and society, and that then individuals, freed from  silly forms - free and happy individuals - will walk the earth in innumerable specimens.    What a festival day it would be for man if suddenly all the houn­daries erected by law and custom, state and society, collapsed! Just this is the meaning of many festival customs: to realize, at least momentarily, this fantasy; and by a kind of illusion to suspend for a  while the established order or to turn it upside down! It was a custom of the Roman Saturnalia for the masters to serve their slaves. In the chaotic carousal of carnival days, in anonymity, in masks, we enjoy the happiness of the moment. The scorning of au­thority and of customs belongs to such festival days. But even fes­tival  days have fixed dates and a prescribed duration. And even fes­tival days need forms; we can only oppose forms by using other forms.    One step further and the hangover will follow the festival. Disgust will follow dissipation. In the dissolution of order, the longing for new order arises no less urgently. Since man wants both the happi­ness of the moment and a hold on strict order, he is contradictory  in himself. The contradiction is most difficult to understand; there­fore, it is easy to accept only one part and overlook or reject the other. The extremists of this third group are called by a friendly name, ""individualists,"" and by an unfriendly name, ""nihilists.""    Their pedagogical theory refutes itself if it is strictly carried out. The norm may be as elastic as you like, the rule may have ever so many nuances - without the norm all shades lose their meaning. You may concede to the individual as many rights as you like: you  cannot free him from limitations and claims.    As individuals we are born, and as individuals we die; as indi­viduals we feel desire, pleasure, and pain. As individualities we are educated by others or else we form ourselves gradually. As indi­viduals we belong to nature; as individualities we belong to a spir­itual,  objective order. As individuals we are marked by some pe­culiarity, such as the finger print; we become individualities in so far as we integrate objective orders and adapt ourselves to them. As individuals' we are specimens of a zoological species, and we are restrained to the present in space and time. As individualities we are in a potential relation toward the whole of the world, to the past and to the future. Because we are all related to one and the same objective order, it may become the norm, the means and the object of education.    The fourth and last group can be described in fewer words. With them the idea prevails that superpersonal forces - economic, spir­itual, instinctive - determine the course of human life. History will follow its course no matter what we try to do. It cannot help mat­ters  to offer any resistance. Our will is impotent. We think of action, but we are only the puppets of stronger impersonal forces. By a friendly name we call this group, ""the fatalists,"" and by an un-friendly name, ""the indolent."" They cannot form a specific peda­gogical  theory of their own.    If the fatalists are right, we can do nothing but sigh because we are born in such a critical time, and sigh about the new epoch to which this crisis seems to lead.  But if the fatalists are not right, if history is not completely dic­tated by superpersonal forces, if the future is not finally determined by the past, if there is space for our own action- then we have to  investigate more carefully the motive forces of this crisis, to find what solutions seem to be possible, which desirable, and which un­desirable.    An analysis of this crisis can be made only by an over­simplification.    This present crisis seems to end an epoch which has lasted for about three hundred years. Let us call it the epoch of enlighten­ment. Historians usually label a somewhat shorter period as the time of enlightenment; but the motives of the enlightenment of the eighteenth century were effective from the beginning of modern  time and retain their force to this day.    Enlightenment was based on confidence III the autonomy of the human mind. This confidence was united with the hope of under­standing nature by rational methods, of thereby eventually domi­nating it, and of ultimately regulating and planning all human re­lations  reasonably. Who would not be delighted at such a prospect? Was not everything to be gained and nothing to be lost? The sacri­fice which this plan demanded of man remained hidden for a long time.    The autonomy of human reason can be preserved only if there is undoubted security in our knowledge. Security of this kind we find in mathematics. In so far as mathematics is competent there is cer­tainty  of knowledge. The autonomy of reason needs knowledge of a mathematical kind. But mathematics can be applied only to a na­ture having a mechanistic structure. Consequently all phenomena have to be explained and understood as mechanism. But in a world based on mechanism there can be no becoming and no history in a true sense. Thus the claim of autonomy of reason forces certain metaphysical interpretations of nature and of all being. Only what is comprehensible by mathematical methods really exists for it.    At first enlightenment intended to dominate only external nature; but very soon man, in so far as he belongs to nature, was included as an object of these same tendencies. To fight misery, want, dis­ease,  and death was the first task; thus the seventeenth century brought modern medicine into existence. But after the bonds which both limited and formed men began to be broken, a tendency toward negative freedom gradually extended to ail human rela­tions.  They all became, one after the other, targets of historical criticism and decomposition. Man wanted to be free. He wanted no other master than himself, either in nature or in a cosmic order.    Thus enlightenment unifies two motives which at the first glance seem to be contradictory to one another- that of exact rationalistic methods and that of individualism almost anarchistic and nihilistic.  The second motive proved to be the stronger one. The skeptical attitude was directed against science itself, not, perhaps, in its obvious results but in the value of scientific reasoning as such.    Rousseau is a famous example of the mutual interference of these two tendencies of enlightenment. Since his time ""irrationalism"" has steadily grown; today there is even a worshipping of anti-rational forces. As long as the struggle to free individuals from all bonds  and boundaries continued, the struggle itself furnished some center of orientation; but thereafter man plunged into the void, the nothingness. Thereby he became ripe for totalitarianism, that strange mixture of rationalism and romanticism.    For a long time the teaching has prevailed that self- preservation is the true and only real goal of all human activity. But the present time proves again that man does not live by bread alone. Nobody will deny the power of economic needs, hut hesides these therc is a  metaphysical dread of the infinite, of the void, of the nothingness. Wealth may provide many means of intoxication and dissipation for the quieting of this dread; misery brings it to its climax, and reveals the true situation of man, confronting him with the infinite.    The totalitarian states have understood these needs of man. They have established an obligatory hierarchy of values in which the economic ones are not the highest or the decisive ones. They under­stand the role that imagination plays in man's psychical life. That  they base the new order on the very questionable opinions of indi­viduals, calling absolute these relative and limited views, must necessarily lead to a conflict with reality; this error transforms their constitution into a cruel and merciless tyranny.    But we must not forget that the dictators rose to power because men were longing for new masters, for new gods. They asked for commandments even if they rejected those given on Mount Sinai. The totalitarian states arose from the crisis. They pretend to offer  solutions for the crisis. Because we abhor a social order of slaves and their masters, we have to ask ourselves if this solution is the only possible one. Therefore our task in education is clear. If all pain and labor, if all the immense expenditure of human thought and energy, is directed only toward self- preservation, then the right and only important thing for young people to do is to  grasp as quickly as possible that knowledge and that skill which are necessary for jobs and for making money. But if this is not true, education must do far more.    First, the eternal questions- to use a solemn word- must become vital questions again; the central problems must become visible again, not as special problems for specialists, but as problems con­cerning all of us and ultimately giving to all our knowledge and skill their real meaning and importance.    Second, if ""freedom"" has not only a negative meaning-- if it means not only to be free from something and to do whatever we want to do- then the individual must again experience himself as a part of a whole, as a part of a lasting, embracing order that he himself helps to form.    Third, if individuality is expressed by the proper relation of the individual to the central problems and by the way the individual lives as a part of the whole, then it becomes each individual's task to develop his individuality, to give to his own life a sensible, con­sistent  meaning and shape.    These are the tasks. How are they to be accomplished? It is simple to formulate a program; everything depends upon how it is carried out:    Knowledge and skill certainly are indispensable; for self- ­preservation, although it is not everything, will always be an essen­tial goal. Furthermore, we can only strive from the periphery to the center; we can only construct a whole from its parts. But the subject matter, important as it is, should not be the ultimate goal  of our learning. To absorb knowledge, to prepare for examinations, or for jobs, should not be the only meaning of our studies. We should not acquire ready- made knowledge, but we should learn to ask questions. A student who leaves a college should not regard  himself as finished, but he should have become a questioning per­son; he should never stop questioning, never stop striving from narrowness to breadth. A student enters college limited, like every  young man, by a narrow horizon of prejudice; his standards are ephemeral. To open the narrow horizon, to give him standards of real greatness, to make him familiar with the complexity of prob­lems-  that is the main point.    To belong as a part to a whole is also easier said than done. ""The whole"" is a name easily misused and easily misunderstood. Does not a soldier also belong to a whole? Surely, but in quite another way. In a campaign the plan of the whole is necessarily secret. Only the  general and a few others know it. The soldier serves the whole, but he neither knows nor understands it, nor can he influence the for­mation of the plan. Unconditional obedience and courage are asked of him. Here the relation of the individual to the whole is an ab­stract one, a passive one, a relation that excludes responsibility. It is not such an integration that we have in mind; it is an antithetical one. By a ""whole"" we mean a community which the individual helps to build, a community in which the weal and woe of the whole depend on the actions of the individuals, one in which the consequences of the individual's actions fall back on him, one in which his actions are not hidden by clouds of anonymity. In the future only a state which is constituted as an organic whole can be  truly democratic.    The democracies of the western hemisphere and of Europe pre­served for a long time the principles belonging to their origin in the English and French revolutions of the seventeenth and eigh­teenth  centuries: the protection of the independence of the individual against the power of the state, and the protection of the rights of the middle-class against those of the classes privileged in the old regime. But this epoch has definitely passed.    Respect for the dignity of the human personality was the moral basis for democracy. This conviction gave it strength in its fight against feudalism. It armed the citizens and disarmed the members of the upper classes hefore they even started their defense. Is this  conviction still alive? What has modern psychology to say about human dignity and freedom? You may open a texthook of psy­chology and find that the first chapter deals with the question, ""What is man?"" You may he surprised or you may not he surprised by the answer given there. The answer is: ""Man is a mass of proto­plasm."" Therefore, human life and the human world have to be explained in the last instance as reactions of protoplasm. This inter­pretation leaves no room for freedom or dignity, hecause the re­actions of protoplasm demand only mechanical, impersonal schemes,  and they can hest he controlled hy political organizations which do not waste their time with such trifles as dignity. It is not too difficult to prove the mistakes and hasic errors of the philosophy represented  hy this kind of modern psychology. The frightening fact is that in spite of its ohvious weakness and queerness, this psychology is ac­cepted almost everywhere throughout the country and is taught with minor variations at almost all universities. There is no douht  that the ground out of which democracy has grown has completely changed- but democracy can exist only in a special kind of ground. The fate of democracy will not he decided on the hattlefields alone. It is also threatened from within, not only hy its open or secret  enemies, hut still more so by those who praise it, unaware that they themselves have already cut it from its roots. The fate of democracy will ultimately he decided hy the convictions and philosophy of the citizens of the democratic countries.    We cannot turn hackward; history will not repeat itself. A new ground will he prepared. Democratic freedom will survive only if there is a complete change in the attitude of the individual towards the state and the whole: a change from claims to duties. Solidarity and respect for the rights of others cannot he hased on emotions  and instincts, hut can only he understood as the obligation of one part of the whole to another part. Because this relation is not a natural instinct it has to he developed, taught and learned. The enormous dimensions of modern states have made it difficult for  many people to understand their own true function and their own role as parts of such an ahstract whole. This relationship can best be learned within a community of small dimensions where the single person can understand the needs of the whole, where he may  help to satisfy these needs, and where he remains visible in all his actions.    But we must be careful not to interpret ""community"" sentimentally; that is, not as a group of people whose aim is merely to make life comfortable and pleasant for each other, appeasing the inevitable tensions. A true community, like an organism, is based upon the  variety of its members and upon the difference of their functions. An organism unifies and binds its separate parts into a whole with­out destroying the difference between the parts. In a whole the indi­vidual  becomes unexchangeable and irreplaceable. Only within a community, therefore, can one exist as an individuality.    A community may be considered in three ways. First, it is never a completed structure. The life of the whole depends upon the life of its parts; it must constantly be formed anew. Thus, a community is a task. Second, as a whole, it subordinates all its parts in one gen­eral  order. Out of a community, therefore, laws and obligations arise. And finally, a community is a place where, in spiritual con­frontation with others, it is possible for a person to realize himself.    Education can help us acquire new knowledge and understanding only if previously a purgation from old errors and mistakes has taken place. It must, therefore, be one of our main tasks to erase the erroneous idea that individuality is equivalent to eccentric pe­culiarity.  Those problems which vexed the great men, thinkers and artists, statesmen and saints, must become our own concern, what­ever our natural talents may be. We need to cultivate them, not in a snobbish manner separated from our daily life, but at its center.  It is certainly not legitimate to expect education to breed geniuses; but it certainly is its function to establish or perhaps to re-establish  the right relation between every-day life and the eternal problems. That is, the great problems should penetrate and mold daily life; yet preoccupation with them should not prevent and excuse us from proving true in the small affairs of every day.

At a  general meeting held that evening,  the College community- seventy stu­dents  and twenty teachers- heard  Robert Wunsch, Rector, and Josef  Albers, speak of the plans for the  year and of some of the ideals on  which the College is based.  "" Black Mountain is a liberal arts  college"", said Mr Wunsch. "" The em­phasis  here, however, has not been  solely on the getting of knowledge  as in so many liberal arts schools,  but on learning to live harmoniously  with other people as well ... Know­ledge  is a way of life, and life is  richer than any of its ways ... An  educated man is only a spectator of  life. A man with an education is a  unit of life and light. We shall con­tinue  to try to wed knowledge to  living . . . We shall try to learn all  we can intellectually about the  Southern Negro, but at the same  time learn to live beautifully with  the people in the kitchen who serve  us; we shall study seriously and  deeply the psychology of the child  but not forget to apply this learn­ing  in our relationships with the  children about the College ... We  must learn the responsible use of  freedom, the willingness to hear di­verse  opinions debated and weighed  within the College; that inner devo­tion  to the common welfare that  In new quarters  makes coercion needless, the volun­tary  assumption of the duties that  democracy entails.""  Mr Albers spoke briefly of his year  away from Black Mountain. "" I  taught at a place proud of a three  centuries' tradition. But it was not  discouraging for me to compare its  status after three hundred years  with the status of another educa­tional,  place which has existed for  only eight years, an institution in  which I believe. I remained hopeful  in spite of six millions of books  compared with only eight thousand,  despite seventy students and twenty  teachers on the one side, compared  with thousands of the one and hun­dreds  of the other . . .  "" We finally are on our own grounds.  And in face of the architectural  works of the last year we see that  the sacrifices and hard work of both  students and teachers have been  worthwhile. Here I hope we will  continue our belief in our. aims amI  our enthusiasms for our work.  "" Since our job here is education,  which means personal growth- of  teachers as well as of students- and  since life means change, our aim is  forward. It must be like real science  and art which naturally strive for  more, namely for the future.  "" What we should carryon, I think,  is our belief that behaviour and so-  ,  cial adjustment are as interesting  and important as knowledge. That  besides statements and statistics we  must cultivate expression and meta­phor.  That the manual type, as well  as eye or ear people, are as valuahle  as the intellectual type.  "" Towards a healthier development  we must balance intellectual studies  with practical work. We must use  tools beside books.""  Robert Babcock, who was co­ordinator  of the work program for  the last few weeks of the summer,  outlined the progress of the build­ing  project over the summer  months, and the work still to be  done. Most of the old students at  the College were back a week early,  working eight hours a day to pre­pare  housing for the community:  installing ceilings and partitions,  building chimneys, and finishing  sleeping quarters for the hundred­odd  community members.  Work for the immediate future is  being concentrated on finishing the  housing and equipping rooms in thc  new Student- Studies Building for  classes, for student and faculty stu­dies,  and for faculty apartments.  Students were urged to volunteer  for at least two or three afternoons  of work a week.  Student meeting  The next evening a student meeting  was called to explain to new stu­dents  the function of the student in  the government of his community.  Harold Raymond, Student Moder­ator  for the year, discussed the rea­sons  for student participation in  government, some of the mechanisms  of that participation, the duties of  the student officers, and the accept­ance  of student agreements as stan­dards  for living. After a period of  discussion, agreements for the year  were made covering the respecting  of do- not- disturb signs, recognition  of Dr Straus as authority in health  matters, and observance of the Col­lege  schedule as to vacation dates.  Temporary handicaps  For the first few weeks of the year  the College is operating under dis­tinct  difficulties. Student studies are  not yet ready for use and studying  must, for the present, be done in  bedrooms, in the library, or in those  faculty studies made available for  student use. Heating is not com­plete  but will be before cool wea­ther  sets in. Much ingenuity has  been shown in the arrangement of  student rooms which for the time  being must be used for both sleep­ing  and studying: some have triple­deck  beds, others counterweighted  beds which rise to the ceiling when  not in use. And amid the minor  chaos that marks the beginning of  a new stage in the development of  the College, the academic work of  the year is under way.  Enrollment  Twenty- two states and four foreign  countries are represented in the en­rollment  for the fall semester. As  in former years, New York and  Massachusetts are first in numerical  repr~ sentation, New York having  sent thirteen students and Massa­chusetts  twelve. California is next  with six students; New Jersey  fourth, with five; and Connecticut  fifth, with four. Other states repre­sented  include Alabama, Colorado,  District of Columbia, Florida, llli-  nois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missis­sippi,  Missouri, North Carolina,  Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah,  Virginia, Washington, and Wiscon­sin.  There is one student from  China, one from Denmark, one from  Germany, and two from Spain; all  five of them are now United States  residents.  There are twenty- two new students  at the College. They are: Shirley  Allen of Wilton, Connecticnt; Mar­ilyn  Bauer of Shaker Heights, Ohio;  Homer Bobilin of Garwood, New  Jersey; Samuel E Brown Jr, of Wil­ton,  Connecticut; Aurora Cassotta  of New York City; Hope Greer of  Mount Kisco, New York; William  Hanchett of Evanston, Illinois; Dora  Harrison of New Orleans, Louisiana;  Eric Haugaard of Cambridge, Mass­achusetts;  Gail Keith- J ones of  Evanston, Illinois; Elizabeth Kulka  of New York City; Ruthabeth Kru­eger  of Wheatridge, Colorado; Ro­hert  Marden of Boston, Massa­chusetts;  William McLaughlin of  Easton, Pennsylvania; Faith Mur­ray  of Charleston, South Carolina;  Ruth O'Neill of Milwaukee, Wis­consin;  Arthur Schneider of Ashe­ville,  North Carolina; Jacqueline  Tankerslev of Saint Louis, Missouri;  Henry T~ ttle of Shaker Heights,  Ohio; Nancy West of Hartford,  Connecticut; Helen Wright of  Watertown, Massachusetts; and Dick  Wyke of Miami, Florida.  "" Psychology of Architecture""  On the evening of Septemher 17,  Erwin Straus spoke to the College  community on the "" Psychology of  Architecture.""  Dr Straus hegan with a discussion  of the psychological origins of archi-tecture.  The needs for shelter and  protection are fundamental in man,  and in these needs can he found the  seeds of architecture. But can all  architecture he explained in this  way?  "" I will take you,"" said Dr Straus?  "" to a hillside overlooking a medi­:  eval European town. From there  we can distinguish clearly two types  of buildings. Little houses like nests  of birds cluster around a tall edi­fice,  usually a cathedral or a castle.  The shape of the small buildings is  hardly noticeable for they are really  nothing more than an extension, a  second floor as it were, of nature. In  contrast to them, the towering build­ing  is superimposed upon nature.  Its plan, its location, its structure,  all testify to a will, a scheme. Why?  \~ 1hat prompted men to raise a  building so differently planned and  constructed? The answer is not in  religion alone, nor does it lie solely  in economic or political considera­tions.  It is not a difference between  public and private, between large  and small, which makes the palace,  the cathedral, the city hall, the cen­ter  of the town. The answer- and in  this answer is the ultimate source  of any architectural scheme which  goes beyond the bare needs of  shelter- lies in the existence of com­munity.  "" The term is an ambiguous one. We  use it carelessly, casually, to indi­cate  groups which are only aggre­gates,  only communal in location,  hy accident, for a moment. The  members of such groups are in no  way related to or part of a whole;  what relations exist are merely he­tween  individual members. Each  individual has his own purpose, and  after leaving the group hecomes  ,  again what he was before he joined  it. Such a group is not a community,  yet it may become one: a fire, a dis­aster,  an event of great importance  may provide a common purpose, a  common fate, for all the members  of the group. But the community  thus created will exist only so long  as the situation exists; when the  event has passed, the community  becomes once more a group or dis­integrates  entirely.  "" But we are beginning to under­stand  the secret of community. Hu­man  community is possible only be­cause  men can share with each other  one and the same all- embracing  order. Belief in a common order,  compelling and directing the lives  of men into one many- sided pat­tern,  shaping the individual fate to  one common fate, brings about com­munity  in the truest sense of the  word. Fate is an order which de­mands  to be lived. The most perfect  community is, therefore, one where  this fate is based on an interpreta­tion  of the most perfect order- the  order of the universe as a whole.  "" By its nature such an order is a  spiritual, an intangible,' an intellec­tual  thing. To tie it to the concrete­ness  of human life, it needs tangible  representation. And architecture­as  a fine art rather than as utili­tarian  housing- is one of the pos­sible  symbolic representations of  this order. It makes visible the in­visible.  So, returning from the psy­chology  of the community to the  architecture of that community, we  can understand that, for instance,  the central and unique position and  plan of a cathedral, a palace, a city  hall, symbolize the unity of the  whole world, just as the solid ma­terial  out of which these edifices  are built represents the stability  and the lasting character of the  unIverse.  "" What happens if unity, plan, order,  are no longer felt? Architectural  style will tend to reproduce tbe lack  of unity, will emphasize the absence  of a center by all the means at its  disposal. It will, for example, trans­form  light perceived as a cosmic  substance into mere lighting; it will  try to hide the boundaries as deter­mined  by the walls of a structure,  to create the impression of an in­finite  multiplicity of shapes within  and around the building. This is the  trend of architecture today, as well  as of interior design. This is the  immediate impression we get III  looking upon a town of our own  day. The whole aspect of architec­ture  as we know it and as we prac­tice  it expresses our attitude towards  a world in which, strictly speaking,  we no longer perceive a universe.""  Faculty appointment  Nathan Rosen, Professor of Physics,  left during September to take a re­search  and teaching position at the  University of North Carolina. Large­ly  through Mr Rosen's co- operation,  Peter Bergmann, who spoke to the  College last year on the Theory of  Relativity, is joining the Black  Mountain Faculty as Assistant Pro­fessor  of Physics.  Like Mr Rosen, Mr Bergmann comes  to Black Mountain from the Insti­tute  for Advanced Study at Prince­ton,  where he has been doing re­search  under Albert Einstein. Born  in Berlin, he was educated in Frei­burg,  Dresden, and at the University  of Prague, from which he has his  Ph D. His work at Princeton began  in 1936.  Mr Bergmann is a member of the  American Physical Society and of  the American Mathematical Society.  He has published research papers  in Czechoslovakia and in America;  his Introduction to the Theory of  Relativity is now in process of pub­lication.  Surette mUSIC collection  The last issue of the Newsletter re­ported  the death of Dr Thomas  Whitney Surette, former member of  the College Faculty and of the Ad ·  visory Council. Since then, Black  Mountain has received from his es­tate  his entire music library.  The collection includes about 400  books, 20 albums of records, and an  extensive collection of musical  scores. Among the books, which in­clude  most of the standard musical  biographies and reference books,  critical essays, and books on mu­sical  education, there are several of  historic interest. The most unusual  of these is a book called Music in  Nature, which belonged at one time  to Ralph Waldo Emerson and which  is annotated by him.  The musical scores in the collection  are of almost all types- choral mu­sic,  piano music, chamber works,  and scores for full orchestra. Repre­sented  are such classic composers as  Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, and many  modern composers, such as Hon­neger,  Holst, Schoenberg, Randall  Thompson, and Vaughan Williams.  The collection includes more than  275 miniature scores for symphonic  works and chamber orchestra, some  of them no longer available.  Shelved with the College's already  sizable music library, the bequest  gives Black Mountain an exception­ally  inclusive and valuable collec­tion  of scores and reference hooks  in musical fields.  Alumni guests  Tasker Howard Jr, who has a posi­tion  with the National Labor Rela ·  tions Board in Washington, D C,  spent several days of his vacation at  the College in July.  Leslie Katz, now working in an ad­vertising  office in New York City,  spent his two weeks' vacation' as a  member of the Work Camp.  Mitzi Martin visited the College  while on a trip through the South  with her parents, Dr and Mrs H  Walford Martin.  Bedford Thurman spent a few days  at Lake Eden before going to Man­teo,  N C, to take part in Paul  Green's The Lost Colony. He is now  in New York City.  Emil Willimetz was a member of  the Work Camp for several weeks.  During the month of July he was  on the staff of the International  Student Service Work Camp at the  Highlander Folk School in Mont­eagle,  Tennessee.  Dr Herminio Portell- Vila, professor  of history at Black Mountain from  1935 to 1938 and now at the Univer­sity  of Havana, stopped briefly at  the College with Mrs Portell- Vila.  He was on his way to the University  of Chicago where he taught during  the summer session.  Summer visitors  Mr and Mrs Fred Wale and their  three children, of Winnetka, Illinois,  Because of the postponement of the college opening until September 22, a  revised calendar for the year has been adopted. Winter vacation will be  from December 21 to January 12, the fall term will end on January 31,  spring vacation will be March 22 to April 5, and College will close on  June 6.  Karl Terzaghi  spent their vacation at the College.  Mr Wale is director for rural edu­cation  of the Julius Rosenwald  Fund, and in this capacity visits  schools and colleges throughout thc  South.  Dr and Mrs Irwin Panofsky of  Princeton, New Jersey, were at Lake  Eden for three weeks. Dr Panofsky,  who is a well known art historian,  is a member of the faculty of the  Institute for Advanced Study in  Princeton. During his visit he gave  an illustrated lecture for Work  Campers and their guests on the  art of Albrecht Durer.  Dr and Mrs Arthur Raper and their  family, of Greensboro, Georgia,  spent about ten days at the College  at the close of the Work Camp ses­sion.  Dr Raper is an economist who  is well- known for his studies of the  sociological problems of the South.  He gave a series of four lectures:  "" Southern Agriculture and Landless  Farmers,"" "" Industry and Organized  Labour,"" "" Race and Class Pres­sures,""  and "" The South Strains To­wards'  Adequacy."" Dr Raper is at  present Social Science Analyst for  the Bureau of Agricultural Econom­ics  in the Department of Agricul­ture.  Mr Leopold Weil and his sister, Miss  Gisela Weil, were guests at Lake  Eden during August. Mr Weil is a  bio- chemist at the Benjamin Frank­lin  Institute in its Newark, Dela­ware,  branch.  Dr and Mrs Egon ,,"" rissing of Bos­ton,  Massachusetts, were guests at  the College early in July. Dr and  Mrs Wissing are both physicians  and are on the staff of the Massa­chusetts  Memorial Hospital.  i  "" The father of soil mecha. nics"", Dr  Karl Terzaghi, visited the College  early in September. Dr Terzaghi is  an engineer with a world- wide repu­tation.  In his special field of earth  study he has been a consultant in  the building of subways and tun­nels,  in highway engineering, and  in other construction problems,  throughout this country and Eu­rope.

In the light  of an army policy which believes that the preservation of liberal edu­cation and its values demands the temporary suspension of such edu­cation, Black Mountain asks whether the successful prosecution of the  war does not depend instead upon as completely and deeply educated a people as possible. Realizing the  necessity of speed in the war effort, the College yet must question the narrow technical training the government is instituting. It asks whe­ther  some knowledge of- and more important, an enormous interest in- the social, psychological, histor­ical,  and economic hackgrounds to the war; its possihle outcomes, the civilizations and cultures out of  which it grew, and the people who are fighting it, is not as necessarv to a democratic army in a people's war  as engineering and mathematical training. Intentionally or otherwise, the army training plan becomes a  regimentation of thinking, a mass­production  molding of ideas and personalities, a way of making func­tional soldier- mechanics instead of  thinking men.    Most colleges and universities seem to agree wholly or at least in large measure with the government's  plans. It is primarily outside of the field of education that Black Moun­tain finds agreement with and sup­port  of its ideas. Wendell Willkie's Duke University speech echoes many things the College has been  writing, saying, and living for ten years. ""So important,"" said Mr Will­kie, ""are the liberal arts for our fu­ture  civilization that I feel that edu­cation in them should he as much a part of our war planning as the  more obviously needed technical training . . . Furthermore, the men and women who are devoting their lives to such studies should not be made to feel inferior or apologetic in the face of a P-T boat comman­der or the driver of a tank. They and all their fellow citizens should know that the preservation of our  cultural heritages is not superfluous in a modern civilization; is not a luxury . . . It is what we are fight­ing  for."" Dorothy Thompson's De­cember 29th column, ""On the Value of Useless Knowledge"", is perhaps  over-emphatic, but says in substance  many of the things in which Black Mountain believes.    The Black Mountain concept of lib­eral education differs in some ways from the education Willkie and Miss  Thompson have spoken of; it is in no sense the exclusively academic education Willkie was defending, or  the non-practical, non-specialist ed­ucation Miss Thompson eulogized. Black Mountain makes academic  training only part of its educational theory, and sees non-intellectual work and community living as also  important in the development of a whole person. It feels that Miss Thompson's ""useless knowledge"" is  often truly useless unless a student is given some idea of what to do with what he knows. It believes in  breadth of curriculum, but at the same time finds necessary discipline in intensive work in a specialized  field.    These are, however, minor differ­ences in the discussion of real lib­eral education versus narrow and  specialized training, whether it be technical, vocational, or academic. Black Mountain believes, and has  for ten years attempted to realize its beliefs, that only through a truly liberal education can a young' per­son  come to any understanding of  the complex and chaotic world in which he lives; that only by coming to see the world as a world of peo­ple,  and by coming to know some of the reasons people agree or dis­agree, the ways in which they live and work side by side, can a student approach the ideal of a hetter so­ciety. A college must be concerned  with scrutinizing the values of mod­ern society and the frameworks through which people see them­selves  and their world; it must ques­tion  convention and tradition, be unafraid to condemn or to criticize, be continually in search of the basic,  the fundamental, and the real. In time of war, when meaningless ver­bal symbols are multiplied a hundredfold, when emotionalism tends  to replace analysis, when propaganda  takes the place of informa­tion, and when unconsidered judg­ments make a thousand interme­diate  greys black or white, such ed­ucation is of tremendous impor­tance.    During December, Alfred Kazin, book editor of The New Republic, and author of ""On Native Ground"",  visited the College and led a discus­sion on ""American Writing and the War"". There is a feeling on the part  of many writers today, he believes, that it is morally wrong to write anything not directly concerned  with the war; that one must write ponderous social novels, discussions of commando tactics, lengthy eulo­gies of naval victories purporting to be poetry but poetical only in form. Lyric poetry has come to be con­sidered by such writers as somehow  treacherous, immoral, ""ivory- tower"". In a time when a realization of the potential and very real beauty of  the world is more necessary than ever before, we read book after book of factual reportage on this or  that area of conflict; we read ro­mantic historical narratives, popu­larizations of technical problems,  discussions of the possibilities of victory by land, by sea, or by air­ - anything, in fact, to keep us from  thinking about what is basic and fundamental to war time as it is to any time: the never-ending, ever-changing, eternally important rela­tionship of man to the world in which he lives, to its beauties and its cruelties, to its living people and its cold facts.    BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE BULLETIN January 1943  Volume I Number 2  Issued four times a year, in November, January, February, and April. Ap­plicationfor entry as second- class matter at the Postoffice at Black Moun­tain,  N. C., under the Act of August 24, 1912, is pending.    Negro education  Another speaker at the College was W A Robinson. the director of the Secondary School Study of the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools for Negroes. Mr Robinson told of the fight of Negroes for better schools since the Civil War.  ""While Negro schools have im­proved tremendously in the period since the war,"" he said, ""the differ­ential  between economic support of white and Negro schools is continu­ally on the increase, in spite of con­stitutional  guarantees of equal sup­port. The problem becomes a legal­istic one, further complicated by the insistence of the Southern vot­ing majority that white superiority  be maintained.    ""A number of moves are afoot to improve the schools. These have in­cluded the Eight Year Study of the  Progressive Education Association, the curriculum improvement move­ments in the states, the Co-operative  College Study, the Southern Asso­ciation Secondary School Study, the Commission on Teacher Education,  and at present the Secondary School Study which I am directing.""    Mr Robinson feels that as Negroes become better educated they be­come more resentful of the impli­cations  of racial inferiority. He said: "" I think that Negroes will con­tinue to strive for emancipation in America until their emancipation is complete and the Negro's place as  an equal in all matters has been fin­ally established. Historically, this is what every submerged and oppress­ed  minority has done.""    New community members  New faculty appointments since the last Newsletter include: Herbert Miller and Eric Bentley in Social  Studies, Anatole Kopp in architec­ture, and Marianne Kopp in mathe­matics. Dorothy Trayer was appoint­ed registrar to take the place of Elizabeth Parker, now working at the new Moore General Hospital, Robert Orr replaced Morton Steinau as assistant treasurer, and Margaret Stenderhoff began work as faculty  secretary.    Herbert Miller is an internationally known authority on racial, minority, and immigration problems. He is the author of ""The School and the Immigrant"", "" Races, Nations, and Classes"", and ""The Beginnings  of Tomorrow"". One of the first out­siders to write about the problems and aspirations of Czechoslovakia,  he was a close friend of Thomas G Masaryk, father and first president of the Czechoslovak republic. At  Masaryk's request, Dr Miller re­vised Czechoslovakia's Declaration of Independence, and so helped to  win international support for the new republic. Before coming to BMC, he taught at Oberlin College,  Ohio State University, and Bryn Mawr College. Since he retired from Bryn Mawr in 1941, he has been  visiting professor and lecturer at a number of colleges.    His courses for the winter term in­clude an introduction to the scien­tific study of society and a more ad­vanced  study of the sociological makeup of America. On Wednes­day, January 20, he spoke to the College community on Asia's part in the war, and in the world after the war. He believes ""that the next  twenty-five years will bring a great­ly deepened sense of values through­out the world: increased ethical and moral values, greater religious free­dom, more concern with carrying the bcnefits of science and technology to all peoples. If we look at Asia, at China, India, and Russia, we can see synthesized there the  great values of civilization.    ""Speaking sociologically,"" he con­tinued, ""it is inevitable that we white races are going to have to learn to live in equality with the colored races. The yellow race alone, for instance, is not only approximately equal numerically to the white race. but has the oldest  culture in the world, dating back four thousand years. In comparison, European culture is very young, for  we can speak of it only in terms of hundreds of years.    ""Asiatics have a time sense which the younger cultures lack; they think in terms of tomorrow and a  hundred years from now while we suffer from a kind of cultural myopia. A solution of the world's pro­blems  is going to demand this time sense. It is going to demand the Chi­nese feeling for ethics, China's  understanding of what it means to live together; India's spiritual depth and its understanding of the mean­ing  of religion; Russia's realization of economic and scientific potentialities, and its understanding of the  need for economic and political equality.    ""If a world as integrated as the world of tomorrow can be said to have a cultural center, I predict  that seventy years from now, that center will be in Asia"", Dr Miller said, ""for in Asia as nowhere else  are the elements of a better and happier civilization.""    Eric Russell Bentley was a visiting teacher during Black Mountain's summer quarter. An Englishman, educated at Oxford and at Yale, he received his PhD in 1941, winning with his doctoral thesis Yale's John Addison Porter Prize. He was a member of the faculty of the University of California last year, and has written widely for such magazines as The Partisan Review, The  Rocky Mountain Review and the New Mexico Quarterly Review. Dur­ing the winter quarter he is teaching courses in European history from 1600-1800 and in current af­fairs, with emphasis on the imme­diate  historical backgrounds to the present war.    Anatole Kopp was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris and at MIT. He is assisting A Lawrence Kocher with  architectural work, and with Mr Kocher is giving a course in archi­tectural history. He is also teaching  building structures, and stage de­sign, and is directing the construc­tion of four music practice cubicles,  being built by advanced architec­tural students. Marianne Kopp, also a student at the Sorbonne and at  MIT, is teaching elementary math­ematics.  (The paragraph on Edward Lowin­sky in the November Newsletter should have read as follows. The  Newsletter apologizes to Dr Lowin­sky for the errors in the original paragraph.)    Dr Lowinsky is widely known as a pianist, a musicologist, and a teacher. He studied at the Univer­sity  of Heidelberg, and lived recently in Holland where he was, until the war, a popular lecturer before  Dutch musical societies. In 1933, his  Book of Children's Music was pub­lished  in Denmark, and in 1937 his study of Orlando di Lasso was pub­lished in Holland. A new book on  Renaissance Music has been accept­ed for publication by the Columbia University Press. At Black Mountain  Dr Lowinsky is working with piano students, teaching music history, and directing the madrigal group.  Mrs Lowinsky is teaching violin and viola.    Children in the community include at present Sandra and Larry Kocher, Boyd and Linn Mattison,  Jane-Ann and Daniel Orr, Helene Kopp, Eddie Dreier, and Joan Stei­nau. Quintus Dreier is at the Warr­en Wilson Junior College in Swan­nanoa; Joan and her mother will leave as soon as Morton Steinau is  settled in his new work.    College news  Courses at the College have been opened to people from the sur­rounding community at reduced tui­tion  fees. This policy supplements the College's program of lectures, concerts, and dramatic skits pre­pared  for army camps, hospitals, sanitariums, and other organizations in the neighborhood, and widens  the welcome Black Mountain has always had for interested visitors. The part of the College in the re­creational program of the new hos­pital is growing; a number of offi­cers and enlisted men came to the  pre-Christmas performance of ""Sha­dow  and Substance"", and others have been regularly at Saturday night concerts and dancing.    Plays in rehearsal at the present time are the Owen Davis - Donald Davis dramatization of Edith Whar-ton's  ""Ethan Frome"", and Moliere's ""The Imaginary Invalid"". Next term will see work started on Maeter­linck's  ""The Blue Bird"", to be pre­sented as part of the Asheville Chil­dren's Theatre series. Three scripts  were sent to the Carolina Dramatic Association's annual contest for ori­ginal plays; they included Erik  Ha. ugaard's full-length "" Each Year the Snow Falls"", Otis. Levy's one­act ""The Insanity of Love"", and Will  Hamlin's radio script, ""Mr Whit­comb  and the Horse"".    Concerts during the fall and winter  have emphasized music by Mozart, Bach, Brahms, and Schubert. Dr Fritz Hansgirg has played several  programs from his large collection of classical recordings; his Ham­mond organ and Steinway grand  are in the Dining Hall and have been used in a number of concerts. The Dining Hall has been repaint­ed,  and the instruments stand against a silver cyclorama curtain, which hangs from ceiling to floor  at the fireplace end of the Hall.    Black Mountain began its radio series over WWNC on Sunday, Jan­uary 10. Programs have included  music played hy Heinrich Jalowetz, Gretel Lowinsky, and Edward Lo­winsky, and talks by Kenneth Kurtz  and Herhert Miller. A series of dra­matic  programs is planned for the near future.    Before he left for a CPS Camp in West Compton, New Hampshire, Alex Reed finished the stone ""quiet  house"" he designed and built as a memorial to Mark Dreier. The house was built almost single­handed;  Reed cut the wood, laid the stone, and wove the curtains at its windows. He felt that there was  much value in doing constructive work during a time of destruction. He means the building to be used  as a quiet place for quiet thinking, a place to get away, if only for an hour, from the pressure and busy­ness  of the College.    Student officers for the winter term are: Samuel E Brown jr, student  moderator, William McLaughlin,  John Swackhamer, and Herhert  Oppenheimer.    John Evarts and Bedford Thurman,  both in training in Florida, were in the cast of ""The Desert Song"", pro­duced at their camp by Joshua  Logan, the director of the Broad­way show, ""This is the Army"". Thurman is now in officers' training  school. Roland Boyden is stationed in Alaska, as a lieutenant (jg) in the Naval Intelligence Service. Anne  and Frederick Mangold are in Mexico City; Dr Mangold is attach­ed to the Requirements Division of  thc Board of Economic Warfare at the American Embassy there. The YMCA- YWCA annual inter­racial  conference has been invited to meet at the College immediately following the end of the spring term  in June. The Textile Workers of America's Southern Training Con­ference has also been, invited to re-turn  to Lake Eden during the sum­mer. It is possible that the College will sponsor a Seminar on America  for Foreign Scholars, in co-operation with the American Friends Service Committee; the Seminar would be  under the direction of Herbert Mil­ler,  who last summer directed the Friends' American Seminar.    Alumni news  Derek Bovingdon and Barbara Sieck were married January 4, the day Derek graduated from officers' train­ing school. He is one of a few mem­bers  of his class chosen to learn to fly the army's Flying Fortress, and is now in training in New Mexico  as a bomber pilot.    Fred Stone and Jane Robinson were married in New York on January 2. Fred is now stationed in New Jer­sey.  When he is transferred, Jane will return to Black Mountain. She has been working in a war plant  during the summer and fall.     Mary Rose Riegger married Harold Aks on December 24. After leaving Black Mountain she took secretarial  courses' in New York and worked  this fall as secretary to a New York doctor.",State Archives of North Carolina;,"Yandle, Ashley",,,Text;,,,,2013-10-03,2013-10-03,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll44/id/571,572.cpd,Volume6/BMCRP_BMCBulletinNewsletterI-No2_LiberalEdToolWar1943-1.pdf,/p249901coll44/supp/571/index.pdf

The majority have had, beyond actual teaching, widely varied life experiences and a number are persons of international  reputation. The ratio of teacher to student at Black Mountain is one to four.    Black Mountain makes academic achievement only part of its edu­cational philosophy, and sees non-intellectual work and community living as definitely important in the development of a whole person. Because of the nature of the life and work in the community, stu­dents have an unusual opportunity for constant daily association with members of the staff, both inside and outside the classroom.    The environment naturally resulting from such close association is conducive to emphasis at Black Mountain upon seriousness of purpose and exceltence of accomplishment.    It is no croubt due to this emphasis that, in ten short years, the leading universities of America have come to look with approval upon students recommended to them by the Black Mountain College faculty.     The Black Mountain. program is in many ways unique. Progress in college and ability to graduate are not mechanically measured. They depend upon individual initiative, ability and achievement.    JUNIOR DIVISION    All entering students are placed in the Junior Division, which is conceived as a period of study, usually about two years, during which students get a strong foundation for later more specialized work in the Senior Division. The Junior Division also serves as  a period of exploration, during which they may familiarize them­selves with the main areas of knowledge: the Arts, the Languages and Literature, the Social Studies and the Natural Sciences.    Entering students usually do not know in what field they wish to specialize or the kind of work they wish to take up after leaving college. Often they make decisions based on ignorance, prejudice or illusion. In the Junior Division they should find their way, broaden their horizons and acquire needed tools.    As a further aid in this direction, each student selects a faculty advisor with whom he frequently consults.    SENIOR DIVISION    When a student feels he IS capable he may apply for  entrance to the Senior Division.    The faculty judges the student's fitness for this advanced work through a review of his academic foundation, his preparation and talent for his particular Senior Division Plan of study, and his  personal development and degree of maturity. These are demon­strated by his record, by his general reputation and by special written and oral examinations, originated at Black Mountain, de­signed to test his capacity as well as his knowledge.    A Senior Division Plan of study sets forth the student's field of concentration. It may begin with only a general outline, which is elaborated and filled in as the work progresses. Flexibility is per­missible but an organic and significant plan must result. Naturally the subject matter itself is a determining factor. The amount and quality of work required for graduation is at least equal to that  required for an A. B. degree at other colleges of high standing.    OUTSIDE EXAMINERS    As an objective test of a student's work for graduation, outside examiners from the foremost colleges and universities, specialists in the field in which the student wishes to graduate, are called to the college to give thorough examinations both written and oral.    The requirements for these final comprehensive examinations vary somewhat according to the field of study, but in general they call for seven three-hour papers with oral examinations following. In  most cases two of these papers deal with the student's subject ex­tensively, one paper with related fields of knowledge, and three papers with subdivisions of the student's subject which particularly interest him. The seventh paper is concerned with some special  problem connected with the subject and may be presented in thesis form. In the arts, performances or exhibitions may take the place of some of these papers.  The examiner's recommendation, coupled with the faculty's detailed    BLACK MOU TAIN COLLEGE BULLETIN August 1943  Volume I Number 5  Issued seven times a year, in August, September, November, De­cember, January, February, and April.

The following are a few of those who have visited the College and served as examiners:     Phillip Putnam Chase  Lecturer in American History  Harvard University      C. F. Tucker Brooke  Sterling Professor of English  Yale University      Robert Roswell Palmer  Assistant Professor of History  Princeton University    John Frederick Dashiell  Kenan Professor of Psychology  University of North Carolina    Calvin Bryce Hoover  Professor of Economics  Duke University    Stringfellow Barr  President  St. Johns College    Marcel Breuer  Assistant Professor of Architecture  Harvard University    Frank Allen Patterson  Assistant Professor of History  Columbia University    Corydon Perry Spruill Jr.  Professor of Economics  University of North Carolina    Dexter Perkins  Watson Professor of History  University of Rochester      Bruce Simonds  Dean, School of Music  Yale University      Christopher Tunnard  Lecturer, School of Design  Harvard University    STATEMENTS OF EXAMINERS    The following are a few brief excerpts, covering a variety of fields, from reports of a number of outside examiners. The full report is a detailed statement, usually two or three pages in length. Pre­sented  to the student upon graduation, this report, together with a comprehensive statement of accomplishment from the student's advisor and major professor, forms a valuable record of his total achievement.    ""I would like to add here that the standard of achievement shown by these students seems to me' an unusually high one. The develop­ing of the individual talents seems to go hand in hand with a de­veloping  of sound human qualities:- for me the best guarantee    3    for further expanding of the personality beyond the guidance of the college.    ""All four students show a remarkable sense of responsibility, expressed in tact toward others and a fair estimate of themselves. They are filled with an unspoiled and refreshing interest toward things to come and to learn. It seems they are not only talented  young people of fresh approach, but workers of exact control and thoroughness, fit for the most varied situations to be faced in the outside world. As far as I can see, the level of these four art students,  represented in their works and in their personalities, is in many directions much higher than that of average college graduates.""  Marcel Breuer, Harvard University, May, 1940    "" To draw comparisons with students in more academic institutions whom I happen to have examined, I would - rate ( the candidate's) performance, both written and oral, as clearly above that of A. B. candidates majoring in Psychology, and superior to that of most A. M. candidates.""  John Frederick Dashiell, University of North Carolina, May, 1937    ""( The candidate) wrote a set of excellent papers ... Her knowledge of the' facts of literary history is also adequately full and detailed... The examination has convinced me not only of the capacity of ( the candidate) herself, but of the educational effectiveness of the honors system in practice at Black Mountain College. This candidate has profited in the development of her own taste and knowledge of life; and she has also been well prepared for further professional study of literature.""  C. H. Gray, Dean, Bard College, May, 1943    ""While certain deficiencies, primarily with reference to factual data, were apparent, these were no greater than were to be expected from an undergraduate majoring in economics. On the other hand (the candidate's) ability to reason upon the basis of the facts and theory which he knew was far above average. I believe he could  carry on competent work as a graduate student in economics or that he would be competent to begin work as an 'apprentice economist' in government employ. My reading of his paper on Co­operative Cafeterias in New York confirms this opinion.""  Calvin B. Hoover, Duke University, May, 1937    ""... I am willing to say emphatically that at the present time he is not only qualified to enter graduate study in Milton in Columbia University, but that he is able to hold his own at the present time with the best of my graduate students ...""  Frank Allen Patterson, Columbia University, May, 1938    4    ""In his written work the candidate gave evidence of unusually wide, and careful reading, of high power of organization and critical evaluation. His performance in ihis area was comparable to Ph. D. preliminaries. In any graduate work in anthropology his prepara­tion  should place him well in the lead of most students.  ""The oral examination, however, was less successful ""  Cora Du Bois, Sarah Lawrence College, April, 1942    ""I feel that (the candidate) should continue her study of music. I understand that her background before coming to college was somewhat limited and with that in view it seems to me that she has made very good use of her time after coming to Black Mountain.""  Bruce Simonds, Yale University, January, 1942    ""Altogether I have formed a very high estimate of ( the candidate). I would have no hesitation in recommending him for admission to graduate work at Columbia, and I would like to have him as one of my students and friends.""  Jeffery Smith, Columbia University, May, 1942    ""In sum, I should judge that ( the candidate's) performance was the equivalent of that required for an honors (cum laude) degree at most colleges and of that required for high honors (magna cum laude) at very many. I should have no hesitation whatever in  recommending her admission to the Graduate School at Duke or any other university for graduate work in psychology.""  Donald K. Adams, Duke University, May, 1942    ""Comparison with other institutions is difficult. I am sure that ( the candidate) has met an exacting test with unusual success, that he would be a credit to any college, and that, had he been a student at any institution with which I am familiar- at Chicago,  Cornell, or Princeton- he would be, in both intellectual preparation and in qualities of personality, among the most promising students in even a large class.""  Robert R. Palmer, Princeton University, May, 1942    ""... His performance in written and oral tests, while by no means superlative, was more than merely satisfactory. He has, I think, gained greatly from his studies and is not without originality.""  Stringfellow Barr, St. Johns College, February, 1942    ""Throughout his examinations ( the candidate) showed an ability to think about musical problems, historical and theoretical, and to arrive at essentially correct solutions, or, at least, appraisals.  ""His musicality was evident not only in his theoretical work but    5    also in his horn playing in which he should be encouraged to con­tinue his studies. In addition he is well qualified to enter any university as a graduate student in musical research.""  William J. Mitchell, Columbia University, May, 1942    GRADUATE STUDY    In the light of similar reports and upon the recommendation of the Black Mouniain Faculty, graduates have been accepted for graduate  study at such universities as Harvard and Columbia, although Black Mountain does not confer degrees. These graduate students have made excellent records at these institutions.    Collegiate evaluation in North Carolina, upon which the privilege of granting degrees is based, is measured quantitatively. This is due to the fact that qualitative exceptions are extremely difficult to determine. These quantitative standards contemplate an enrollment  of at least one hundred students in a college, require an extensive physical plant and equipment for this number and insist upon a substantial financial endowment. Thus a college like Black Moun­tain falls outside the terms of definition. In the words of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction: ""After considering the mat­ter carefully, we are convinced that we do not have standards for the accrediting of an institution such as Black Mountain College.""    However, in the ten years of its history, the College knows of only one instance where the lack of a degree proved a handicap to a Black Mountain graduate, and in this one case the circumstances responsible no longer obtain.    TRANSFER    In the past, instances have occasionally arisen in which the College was unable to offer advanced work in a particular area. In these cases students were urged to transfer to a university. Fortunately today, with a greatly enlarged teaching staff, similar suggestions  are less frequently necessary.    As a result of this, however, over a period since the founding of the college a number of students have transferred to such institu­tions as the University of North Carolina, Northwestern, Columbia and Yale Universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Radcliffe and Swarthmore Colleges, where they have proved the value of Black Mountain training by doing excellent work.    Black Mountain's program is not designed for purposes of transfer. It is essentially a unique one, hased upon the belief that, in them­selves, grades and credits are not educational aims. Yet students whose circumstances require that they transfer should encounter no unusual difficulties.  6    7    APPROVAL FOR ENLISTED RESERVE    Black Mountain was assigned a quota in the Army's enlisted re­serve corps. Excerpts from letters written by several colleges attest to the U. S. Army their confidence in Black Mountain's standards and their attitude in regard to Black Mountain students who wish  to transfer.    ANTIOCH COLLEGE  Yellow Springs, Ohio  Offices of Administration  May 26, 1942    Mr. W. R. Wunsch, Rector  Black Mountain College  Black Mountain, North Carolina    Dear Mr. Wunsch:    Our delay in responding to your letter of May 7 did not mean lack of friendly interest in a matter so vital to Black Mountain College. It was difficult to find a time to bring your letter to the attention of the Administrative Council. When it was discussed, the Council indicated its entire willingness to accept Black Mountain students at Antioch without loss of time and on the same basis  as students from accredited colleges. There has been enough traffic of students between the two institutions for us to have gained a considerable knowledge of and respect for the academic standards of Black Mountain. Mr. Walter Locke of Dayton, who is a member  of our Board of Trustees, is also a member of your Advisory Com­mittee and has visited your campus several times. We have consulted with him and he concurs in our judgment that Black Moun­tain  maintains high academic standards. Louis Adamic who was on our campus just last week also knows Black Mountain and has expressed a high opinion of it to us.    I should add that the reports of your outside examiners on the comprehensive examinations taken by your students were most impressive.    We are willing to have you quote us as follows: Antioch College has been requested by Black Mountain College to make a formal statement to the effect that it will admit transfer students from Black Mountain. Because Antioch respects the work which Black Mountain is doing, and knows about it through student traffic between the two colleges, through faculty visitations and through Mr. Walter Locke of Dayton, Antioch Trustee, who is a member of the Black Mountain Advisory Committee, Antioch is glad to make such a statement. However, Antioch College in making this  statement wishes to make entirely clear that it does not consider itself in any respect an accrediting agency- except in the sense that every college makes judgments about both high schools and collegesin deciding whether to give full credit to their courses.    Antioch College will accept the students, either graduate or undergraduate, of Black Mountain College, on the recommendation of the Faculty of Black Mountain College, at Yellow Springs with­out loss of academic time (that is, to similar yearly standing) and without special examinations and subject only to the con­ditions which students of Antioch College normally accept. Black  Mountain College is hereby authorized to use this statement in petitioning the proper Army and Navy departments for partici­pation in their various programs for which formal accerditing is normally expected and in demonstration of their ability to fulfill the requirements which the Army and Navy may normally expect  to ask of participating institutions. ( End of statement for quo­tation).    We hope that this statement will be of some value to you in your efforts to secure Army and Navy approval.  Sincerely yours,    W. B. ALEXANDER  Dean of Administration.    THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  Chapel Hill  Frank P. Graham, President    To the Secretary of the Navy,  To the Secretary of War:  June 10, 1942    The University of North Carolina, aware that Black Mountain College is not yet accredited by the North Carolina Conference or the Southern Association, does nonetheless accept its students on the recommendation of Black Mountain College, at Chapel Hill subject only to the conditions which the University of North Caro­lina  normally applies. Black Mountain College is hereby authorized to use this statement in petitioning the proper Army and Navy de­partments for participation in their various programs for which formal accrediting is normally expected and in demonstration of their ability to fulfill the requirements which the Army and Navy  may normally expect to ask of participating institutions.    Very sincerely yours,  FRANK P. GRAHAM.    SWARTHMORE COLLEGE  Swarthmore, Pa.  May 27, 1942    Dear Mr. Wunsch:  I am happy to inform you that Swarthmore College will ac­cept students from Black. Mountain College on precisely the same grounds on which we accept students from other institutions. We should want the recommendation of your faculty; and we should  then want to have a personal interview, to study the applicant's program, and to set any qualifying examinations which seemed necessary. We should require the same conditions from students from other colleges or universities.    Black Mountain College is hereby authorized to use this state­ment in petitioning the proper Army and Navy departments for participation in their various programs for which formal accredit­ing is normally expected and in demonstration of their ability to fulfill the requirements which the Army and Navy may normally expect to ask of participating institutions.    Yours sincerely,  JOHN W. NASON,  President.    ALUMNI    In spite of the short period of time that Black Mountain alumni have had in which to prove themselves, the positions of typical graduates and former students give evidence of the fact that these persons are already becoming effective citizens in the communities in which they have settled.    Naturally the majority of the Black Mountain alumni and former students are at present in the armed services, where they are acquiting themselves admirably. Two were at Guadalcanal; one was killed while piloting an army bomber; the first. non-commission­ed WAC to land in England was a former Black Mountain College student.    OPINIONS ABOUT BLACK MOUNTAIN    Today Black Mountain is not only making it possible for its stu­dents to get a superior education but as may be gathered from the following comments by noted authorities the worth of this edu­cation is rapidly becoming accepted.    ""Mere words would not convey my enthusiasm for all the work    9    which you people are putting into building up an outstanding edu­cational institution. It seems almost incredible to me that you could have accomplished all that the pictures in the bulletin show.""  DOUGLAS BEMENT, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.    "" Black Mountain is a living example of democracy in action.""  JOHN DEWEY.    ""The substitution of practical work on the farm and in building is a great idea. The second unique advantage of the College is the close personal relation between students and faculty. In both these respects Black Mountain is not merely better than the average  place, but would, so far as my knowledge goes, be number one in the United States.""  FRANK AYDELOTTE, Director, Institute for Advanced Study, Prince­ton, New Jersey.    ""I sincerely hope that the War will not interfere with the progress and growth of Black Mountaill College. You stand for something distinctive in American education and deserve the support of all those who are interested in educational developments. We wish you the best of success and assure you of our desire to be of assistance whenever we can.""  C. H. GRAY, Dean, Bard College, Columbia University.    ""Black Mountain College has built up a new educational curriculum with very great success. We have followed the results and been very favorably impres. sed.""  JOSEPH HUDNUT, Dean, School of Design, Harvard University.    ""I only wish that many boys and girls could take advantage of this intimacy in education. If they did, I am afraid that your college would lose its charm.""  MERRIL BISHOP, Principal, Harris School, San Antonio, Texas.    ""I want to congratulate you upon the work you are doing. You are here as a little community to work with your hands and your brains, which is a good thing for you. What is done out of pleasure is much better done than what is done out of duty. If you had to climb  mountains out of duty, you would not mount these high mountains. I think that is also true with the high mountains of the spirit.""  ALBERT EINSTEIN.    ""This remarkable educational institution, in the mountains of North Carolina, is a Democracy in the new understanding of the word; not an aggregate of opinion, an addition of votes, but an organic whole in which there is reciprocal dependence between the individual and the general order. It has already become a model  for the deep changes which must take place in American education.""  EDWARD A. OLDHAM, Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel.    ""There should be at least one college such as this in every state, operated independently of the big universities, to provide custom­tailored education for those who want it and to do the experimenting of which the big schools are almost incapable.""

While here they reviewed the work of students in art  and textile design, outlining particularly the work to be done by those who  hope to graduate in the spring or summer. The Albers will resume their  teaching in February. Meanwhile they will be in New York City, where  Mr. Albers will be planning for an exhibition. During their sabbatical  leave, the Albers first travelled to the west coast by car and then to New  Mexico and Mexico. Mr. Albers was busy with his painting; Mrs. Albers  with writing. Also on leave from the college were three collections of Mr.  Albers' paintings and prints, on exhibit in numerous galleries and colleges,  among them the Museum of Denver, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Pasadena  Art Institute, Art Institute of Chicago, and the California Palace of the Legion  of Honor.  Harriet Engelhardt Textile Collection  Mrs. Albers has collected material for the Harriet Engelhardt Memorial  Textile Collection. Up to date this consists of seventy- seven pieces, mostly  of Mexican origin, but including also weavings from Sardinia, Italy; Bolivia;  and Peru. Some are antiques: specimens from Peru, a serape from Saltillo  and one from Queretaro, Mexico. Main choice is of woven textiles, though  embroideries and braided pieces are' included in the collection. The textiles  have not yet arrived at the college, as they have still to go through the  customs.  Pianos  Two new pianos have been added to the joy of music students and all others  who have been aware of the need in this department. A good used Steinway  was purchased with $ 1350 raised in a whirlwind campaign of three weeks'  duration with gifts coming from those here and friends outside the college.  This is used in Charlotte Schlesinger's study for teaching. A used Chickering  was purchased with the remainder of the fund. It is to be in the dining hall  for practice and for dance music, furnished by Tite, Perrow, Lane, and  certain nameless guitarists.

Bolotowsky Shows  I  The Pinacotheca Gallery in New York presented a one- man show of IIya  Bolotowsky's paintings during lNovember. Among them were twelve small  gouaches of neo- plastic geometrical abstract style, and ten large paintings;  all were done at Black Mountlain College. IIya now has a painting in the  Carnegie Annual Show in Pittsburgh, and one at the Chicago Art Institute.

Harriet, originally from Asheville, attended Radcliffe; she is  helping with menu planning and other kitchen and dining room needs.  A drama course given by Art Penn is the result of the successful production  last spring of. three one- act plays through the inspired initiative of the  students. Penn, who directed the plays, asked to give a course this fall and  has about twenty working with him. As a student- teacher Penn is getting  it from both sides now.  riters and the community as a whole were gladdened' by a visit recently  of Anais Nin, who spoke about new techniques and structures and the use  of the unconscious in writing, and the responsibility of a writer. She con­ferred  generously with individuals and carried away with her a couple of  manuscripts. She was particularly interested in the print shop, since she and  her husband hand- set all of her works for years before they were sought by  a commercial publisher. She believes that the influence upon writing  would be for the best if every writer had to print some of his own works.  Marguerite and Franz Wildenhain, potters from Pondfarm, California, were  recent guests of Trude Guermonprez. Mrs. Wildenhain spoke informally to  the community about ceramics and exhibited some of the Pondfarm pottery.  Both were glad to meet the Albers after twenty- five years, since all had  ,.. studied together at the Bauhaus.  John Allcott, head of the Art Department at the University of North Caro­lina,  and his wife, June, were week- end visitors in October, coming particu­larly  to see modern architecture at BMC and to arrange for an exhibit of  BMC architecture at the University in late January. A group of students  with the help of Ted Dr"" eier are preparing the exhibit. The weaving depart­ment  has already sent an exhibit of textiles for an exhibit there.  Professor William Morse Cole was on the campus for three weeks making  the annual audit of the college books. Printed reports will be mailed to  those interested in receiving them.

This Work Camp will be a part of the whole summer  program of the College and members of the camp will be entitled to participate in college activities, such as lec­tures, concerts, choral singing and one course. Since the  students and many members of the faculty devote fifteen hours a week to the farm, construction, and maintenance work of the College, campers will not be set apart, but will be sharing in the normal life of the College com­munity. Campers live in the College dormitories.    Work. The College owns and operates a one hundred acre farm. The livestock includes twelve dairy cows, thirty head of beef cattle, and thirty hogs. About forty acres in feed crops and five in vegetables. Work Campers help in the care and harvesting of these crops, fencing, cleaning and clearing land, and farm construction. Work on the farm is under the supervision of a resident pro­fessional farmer.    Construction and maintenance work, though subject to  wartime restrictions, will offer experience in carpentry,  plumbing and electricity, road work, and trucking, grad­ing, and stone work. A professional builder is employed  by the College.    The work of the community is organized by students  who are in regular attendance at the College.    Applicants for the Work Camp. Applicants should have  completed their first two years of high school or be of  college age.    Since campers are members of the community, their  ability to take responsibility and to contribute to the  life of the community will be considered.    The number of members in the Work Camp will be  limited to twenty.    A fee of $14.00 per week covers the cost of room, board, instruction, and use of the College tools and facilities.    An extra tuition charge is made if a camper wishes to  take academic work or a tutorial in more than one  subject.    Campers work five hours a day. A limited number of  campers may work eight hours a day for room and board. But they can do this only after they have worked for the College for some time and have been proved competent.    Work Campers may attend for the entire period or apply  for any specific consecutive period of not less than one  month.  6    BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE  This is a unique educational experiment, where the stu­dents and faculty are not only building their own build­ings but really are attempting to demonstrate democratic  procedure in an educational institution.  ELEANOR ROOSEVELT (My Day, April 10, 1941).    Black Mountain is a living example of democracy in  action. JOHN DEWEY.    I want to congratulate you upon the work you are doing.  You are here as a little community to work with your  hands and your brains, which is a good thing for you.  What is done out of pleasure is much better done than  what is done out of duty. If you had to climb mountains  out of duty, you could not mount these high mountains.  I think that is also true with the high mountains of the  spirit. ALBERT EINSTEIN.    Progressive education's most famous outpost.  Time Magazine, Dec. 27, 1943.    There should be at least one college such as this in every state, operated independently of the big universities, to provide custom-tailored education for those who want it and do the experimenting of which the big schools are almost incapable. P. M.    Nowhere on American college campuses is there to be  found a more democratic spirit.  The Archive, Duke University, Durham, N. C.    I had thought to stay an hour or so, then to go. To  shorten a long tale, instead of staying overnight, I re­mained for two and a half months. On the third day I  found myself making notes about the place. And two  weeks later I knew I had stumbled on what might event­ually prove one of the most fascinating and probably im­portant stories developing in America today.

It was fun to see it change' with three seasons. It was a relief iIi the fall when  the different greens of winter wh~ at, rye and barley cover crops replacing the  tired silage corn and soybean stubble.  During the winter the main cropping was compost; a whole village street of  rectangular piles which grew and were turned over and over and each time  examined ( for rate of decay) with almost morbid solemnity.  There is a milking machine, the cow stalls in the big barn have been floored  with cement, there are individual drinking cups for the cows, the disk harrows  have been brilliantly painted, the wheelbarrow is bright blue. Also the beef  herd has decreased ( we ate a good many) and the dairy herd enlarged. It was  planned that way. The community needs more milk. So the size of the beef  breeding herd has been cut down to enable the farm to support more milk  cows. Junket, an itinerant Guernsey heifer, upset the plans somewhat by  having a black beefy calf.  This spring the gully near the Jalowetz cottage has been cleared for a calf  pasture. The dairy and beef cattle have had nearly three months of grazing on  selected, newly fenced, strips of cover crop which not only pleases the cows,  but it also looks well.  Now the potatoes are planted, silage corn, oats and landino clover. There are  cabbages and onions well along above Black Dwarf, lettuce, radishes and  ( bewilderingly enough) cactus and lilies too, are in the Albers' garden, and  in front of the gradually growing farmhouse beans and sweet corn. Bennett's  land, eight acres which we rent, is in spring oats; and lespedeza in Morris's  land, 12 acres up the valley, there are oats and barley, clover and lespedeza.  Forty- five hundred small trees have been planted on the eroded and steep  parts of the mountain pasture; locusts, balsam, white pine: reforestation.  There is a big unloading fork in the barn, three Guernsey calves rapidly grow­ing,  health records and tests, and more which isn't seen so clearly.  Clifford Moles and Raymond Trayer have planned it all, directed it, and done  it with student help, hard, work, and excitement. They practically iron the  fields after planting to insure order. They are a mechanized pair and pretty  gay with their tractor. Perhaps it is all right for the time being that they  have to use the horses to help too.  Mary Gregory  IN AND OUT  Josef Albc; rs' most recent paintings were exhibited during April at the Egan  Gallery in New York.  In an exhibition entitled The White Plane held at the Pinacotheca in New  York March 19 - April 12, paintings by Ilya Bolotowsky and Josef Albers  were included with the work of ; Arp, Bucheister, Diller, Gabo, Kandinsky,  Klee, Leger, Lissitsky, Mondrian, Schwitters and several other well known  artists.

But, although a general agreement seems to exist upon the necessity  of teaching physics, two main questions still remaih unsettled. First.  what is the reason for introducing this science subject into the field  of the humanities? Second, how should the subject be approached?  The purpose of this paper is to search for answers- to these two · con­comitant  questions in connection with the preparation of a physics  textbook. Actually, the number of textbooks in physics is, according  to the publishers. larger than in any other branch of science, yet  apparently too few of these books are suitable for liberal arts students.  Why is this? Can it be because the approach to physics, and the  reason for teaching it at all, are not clear?  The teaching of physics within a curriculum of a definite scientific  training for a definite purpose follows a definite pattern. This pattern  reflects two requirements: transference of definite data to the mind  of the student, and development in the student of a scientific method  of approach to the subject. By scientific method one means the ability  to form a logical development of thought within given limits. -  Premedical or engineering preparation stresses the first of these  requirements - that of transferring data to the student's mind; for  science st4dents going into graduate work, and particularly on the  graduate level, the second prevails - that of developing a scientific  method of approach.  This pattern disappears when physics enters other curricula. If  physics is not to be taught for the sake of physics one has to define  the reason for the sake of which it is to be taught. The many possible  answers to this _ question can be divided into three main categories  according to whether the answer stems from the technical, the philo­sophicaL  or the psychological point of view.  From the technical point of view, one may assume thatphysics should  be taught to everyone in order to enable him to learn the functioning  and repair of the various "" automata"" in use in any household, farm,  office, or plant. Consequently, the teaching of physics will consist  of the study of progressively complicated mechanisms of all kinds so  as to unravel for the student the multiple automatic or semi- automatic  devices. In short, it will be a "" technical"" study of a number of  mechanisms wEose selectio WI e 8etermme y e relative  lffiportance given to the various necessities of life.  one approaches the subject from the philosop lcal point of view,  en emphasis falls on the role science has played and is playing in  our civilization The method of teaching relevant here has been  described by James B. Conant in an illuminating article 1 where he  states that "" the understanding of sGience by a layman can be best  ac . ved th? aU'gn: a few relativel sim e case histories in which the  four followmg pomts wou e illustr2. ted:  The influence of new techniques of experimentation  their connection with practical arts.  The evolution of new concepts from experiment.  The difficulties of experimentation and the significance  controlled experiment. .  The development of science as an organized social activity.""  From e standpoint of the third category, the "" psychological"" point  of view, physics becomes not the goal but a means of learning, lead­ing  to the development of a scientific method of approach to all types  of human activities. This point of view - in which I am interested­is  substantiated by · two considerations. .' t the ~ esent interes of  scientific inve tigation seems to center upon the study of "" man"" and  . iSJ- EUafums witb..

As a matter of fact, we seem to have progressed very far in our  knowledge of the physical world consisting of "" periodic crystals,""  but we seem very far behind in understandin the living organisms  formed essentially by "" aperiodic crystals."" 2 e study of the func­tioning  of cells remained for a long time in the purely descriptive or  cataloging stage.) It is only within recent decades that some progress  has been made - for which we are mainly indebted to the physicists,  chemists, and mathematicians who migrated into ilie fields of biology,  h siology, and neurolog . . .  The results of this "" transference"" of scientific technique brought about  y the in asion of one field with the technique of another are quite  surprising.

Thus were born the  "" borderline"" sciences, whose history and implications are set forth  with great clarity by Norbert Wiener in his book on Cybernetics. 3  is mergence of sciences implies quite clearly that humanity, emerg­mg  from the era of specialization, is moving toward the "" universality  of knowledge"" which characterized the human tendency of say a  century ago. The universality we are approaching now is, however,  infinitely more complex than the universality of a hundred years ago)  One hundred years ago it was possible for a scientist to know all the  information available at that time in all branches of knowledge. Earlier  still, a "" physicist"" needed to know only the three basic elements­water,  air, and fire - in order to "" understand"" the whole universe.  Now, in order to grasp what is known of the ten or so elementary  particles of the nucleus one has to spend ten years in sustained and  highly specialized study.  I the light of this situation it becomes clear that discrete domains of  h sics can e enlargea anI y a gifted- aiid rivileged few because  . e sUl3jec is alread so far advancea and involved. . as of us may  hope to un erstand- on y a fraction of a brandl 0 science. Conse­quently,  it is not only impossible to be universal in all sciences, one  cannot be universal even in one science. The borderline sciences,  however, can be advanced by common effort on the part of different  specialists who speak a common language.  To participate in the borderline sciences demands on the one hand  a profound knowledge of a particular field and on the other hand some  understanding of other fields or at least of the language of the others.  If this is so in the realm of science, it is still more so in the domain a  the social sciences.  If this outline of the present situation is valid, if the factors I have  mentioned grow more and more dominant in the development of  human knowledge, then teaching physics to students of the humani­ties  acquires a definite reason. In the future the student will, as a  matter of course, encounter the scientific approach to, and scientific  interpretation of, various data and therefore will have to carry with him  a training enabling him to understand and to perform these processes.  Of what does this training consist, aside from accumulating positive  data which can be acquired from any textbook? In my opinion it  consists mainly in the development of the capacity of systematic  analysis of data - any data - followed by equally strict and system­atic  synthesis.  To ac this capacity the mind has to be trained to a mental dis­cipline.  So far as I know, this discipline can be acquired best and  most bro dly through the study of the precise sciences, among which  physics represents a particularly adequate operational medium be­cause  it requir s one or more strictly logical sequences of ideas within  definite limits. Furthermore, the knowledge of physics, which is the  root of severa ranches of human knowledge, will allow the student to  approach, understand, and correlate a great many borderline subjects.  Thus ph sic _ a subject of the "" Humanities"" curriculum becomes  priman y not a goaLout a means of developing the mind so . that it  is able to pursue a logical trend of thought within the limits 9f the  material un er cons1 era'  1ven 1S approac to the teaching of physics, the ne important  point is the selection of the material to be presented. The choice  must, it seems, be guided by two independent considerations: the  mathematical background of the tudent, and the importance of the  material in relation to other fields.  In other words, the material to be presented to the student can cover  all the fundamental ideas and principles of physics whose final for­mulation  can be expressed in simple mathematical language. But  this material is rather extensive and the problem of its presentation  becomes a very difficult one.  Since the main object of teaching physics falls into two categories­training  in logical thinking, ana- correiation of data obtained in one  field with data obtained in other fields - part of the material has  to be presented with the two goals in mind. The first can be achieved  by emphasizing the step- by- step process and the second by taking  the fundamental results and correlating them with social science,  literature, etc) .  For example, notions such as the kinetic theorY, oj gqses ( introducing  the importance of probability), entropy ( pointing out the role oLdis­symetry,  ilie aw a gravitation, etc., are particu arly suitable for  general interpretation. I 1S, nowever, important to point out that  physical laws do not explain - tEey demonstrate.  ach branch of physics can be explored from the dual point of view-)  rigorous analysis and synthesis, and relationship to the branches of  different areas of human activities.  If contemporary thought is to be dominated by the notions of univer~  sality, of the interpenetration of highly complex fields, and of the  scientific approach to the exploration of the phenomenon - man­then  scientific training such as I have described should be highly  valuable, indeed almost essential, to all students, whether they are  destined to become artists, businessmen, farmers, housewives, or  scientists.  t James B Conant: ' On Understanding of Science""- American Scientist ( 947) p 33  2 Erwin Schrodinger: WHAT IS LIFE?- MacMillan 1947 p 3  3 Norbert Wiener: CYBERNETICS- Wiley 1948  4 Alfred Einstein and Leopold Inleld: THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS- Simon and  Schuster 1942 p 29",State Archives of North Carolina,"Yandle, Ashley",,,Text;,,,,2013-10-03,2013-10-03,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll44/id/582,583.cpd,Volume6/BMCRP_BMCBulletinNewsletterVII-No3_PhysicsLibArts1949-1.pdf,/p249901coll44/supp/582/index.pdf

FOURTEENTH COLLEGE YEAR OPENS  GROWING PAINS  Black Mountain College is larger  this year than it has ever been. When  school opened, September 18, 92  students were enrolled: 49 men and  43 women. Forty of these were new  students. At BMC as elsewhere,  growth has its effects on living.  Four units of temporary government  housing for GI's have been under  construction for some weeks and are  expected to furnish additional sleep­ing  and study space by the first of  the year. Students on the work pro­gram  are providing part of the labor  supply, turning their earnings over  . to the college. These impatiently  awaited buildings are spaced over  the grounds: one below South Lodge,  one between the Studies Building  and the Office, two in the rhododend­ron  thicket above the Mac Wood  cottage. Until these are completed,  ten students must room at Mrs. Pat­ton's,  down the road a half mile;  and many share studies.  In spite of the best efforts of the  faculty in providing a varied cur­riculum  and in advising against too  heavy a schedule, classes are large.

Niebyl  Mary Caroline Richards  Mary Caroline Richards  John Lewis Wallen  John Lewis Wallen  Alice K. Rondthaler  acted as interpreter and taught Rus­sian  to officers and enlisted men.  Francisca Mayer is continuing the  instruction in textile design which  she began at the Summer Art In­stitute.  Born in Hamburg, she re­ceived  her teaching diploma from  Johanna Brunson's Weaving School  in Stockholm, and was associated  with workshops in Denmark and  Germany. In 1938 she became weav­ing  instructor and designer for the  industrial department of the Gren­fell  Association in Labrador. During  the war she worked as occupational  therapist and assistant director of the  Grenfell orphanage. In 1945 she  came to the U. S. and was connected  with workshops in New York City.  Miss Mayer is a niece of Dr. Dehn.  Newly a member of the music depart­ment,  Charlotte Schlesinger came to  Black Mountain this fall from the  Foxhollow School in Lenox, Mas­sachusetts.  Originally she came from  Berlin, where she took professional  training at the Hochschule fur  Musik, majoring in composition.  And also where she won the Beethov­en  prize in 1929 for a chamber music  work. Between Berlin and the U.  S., Miss Schlesinger taught in Vienna  and in Kiev. She directed the first  European performance of Hinde ·  mith's opera, "" Wir hauen eine neue  Stadt.""  Dr. Karl Niebyl, economist newly  appointed to the faculty, arrived  with his wife after a summer as  visiting professor at the University  of Texas. Dr. Niebyl took his degree  at the University of Wisconsin. He  has taught at Carleton College and  at Tulane University. During the  war he was active in the educational  services of the Navy.  Mrs. Margaret Brown joined the Col ·  lege staff this year as supervisor of  the dining room and kitchen. She  had previously been youth counselor  and assistant director of the coopera­tive  camp and small community at  Circle Pines Center, Cloverdale,  Michigan. "" Peggy"" is a Westerner,  from Jackson Hole and the Teton  county in Wyoming, where she  managed a dude ranch. Mrs. Brown  and her sons, Jerry and Stanley,  occupy the old Straus cottage  ( which, by the way, work crews  have completely redecorated).  Christa Noland, wife of one of the  students, Harry Noland, is a register­ed  nurse and has been given charge  of the infirmary.  ' Theodore Dreier, back from his  year's leave, has been re- elected  Rector and is teaching mathematics.  He and Mrs. Dreier have a new  baby girl, Barbara Beate, born in  Asheville on August 9.  Dr. Max Dehn is on leave until Feb­ruary.  He is teaching mathematics  at the University of Wisconsin this  fall.  Dr. Erwin Straus and Trudi left the  end of August for Lexington, Ken­tucky,  where Dr. Straus has accepted  a position as director of clinical  psychiatry at the Veterans Hospital.  He has just completed two years of  research on a fellowship at Johns  Hopkins, the results of which will  be published in a series of papers  some time during the winter.  Elliott Merrick, who taught English  here last year, is now doing an  editing job for the Forestry Division  of the Department of Agriculture in  Asheville.  "" Unwanted: Liberal, creative, sound  educational living, by complacent,  sedate, well- established college,"" an  article by John Wallen, BMC psy­chologist,  appears in the current  issue of Motive, a magazine of the  Methodist Student Movement, pub­lished  in Nashville. Wallen believes  that the "" human climate"" of the  college may be more important than  its curriculum, that "" the deepest and  most significant learning comes as  a result of close contact and inter­change  with other persons."" "" The  task the liberal arts college must  face,"" he writes, "" is that of enabling  the student to define the ends for  which he lives."" Wallen suggests  ways in which this task may be per­formed.  Last January his book,  Counseling with Returned Service  Men, was published by McGraw- Hill.  It was written in collaboration with  Dr. Carl Rogers, head of the training  program for psychological counseling  at the University of Chicago. "" We  3  wrote the book,"" Wallen reports,  "" for a non- technical audience. It is  addressed to people whom veterans  are likely to consult - teachers,  preachers, personnel agents, and so  forth - people who are not trained  counselors but yet have to function  well in a counseling situation.""  Dr. Edward Lowinsky has been a­warded  a Guggenheim Fellowship,  which he plans to take advantage of  next year. He expects to write a  history of the motet, from Ockeghem  to Orlando di Lasso, and hopes to do  his research in Rome. Although the  award was made for 1946- 7, Dr.  Lowinsky petitioned for a year's  postponement of the prize so that  he might carryon the music program  here and rebuild the department  which suffered such a profound loss  in the death of Dr. Heinrich J alowetz  last February. His book, Secret  Chromatic Art in the Netherlands  Motet, was published by Columbia  University Press in March, 1946.  Josef Albers was one of three invited  to lecture before the annual con­ference  of the Cooke- Daniels Me­morial  Foundation, held July 23 to  26 at the Denver Art Museum. Other  lecturers were Sheldon Cheney, well­known  author of art history, and  Georgy Kepes, professor at Massa­chusetts  Institute of Technology. Mr.  Albers' lecture, "" On General Educa­tion  and Art Education,"" will be  published by the Foundation.  Early last spring two collections of  prints by Josef Alberts were shipped  about the country to be shown at  Yale University Gallery, Cranbrook  Academy, San Francisco Museum,  San Diego Museum, and other  places. This fall his prints are being  shown at the Art Institute of Chi­cago,  and the Egan Gallery in New  York.  BUILDING  Permanent Building Plans for the  College are being studied and a re­port  on them will be made later. The  building fund has now reached $ 11, ­508.85  thanks to a recent anonymous  gift of $ 5,000.00.  BAS ALLEN  Bascomb Allen died on August  27th, without regaining conscious­ness,  three days after being hit ~ y  a truck while crossing the street m  the town of Black Mountain. He was  58 years old.  Bas Allen had general supervision of  all maintenance work at the college.  Although he was not officially on  the faculty, he was an indispensable  teacher and much that one learned  from him was not to be found in  books. The way one learned was by  working with him"" on the job, oil all  kinds of jobs.  He joined us when the College  started, in September, 1933, , and had  been with us ever since. From the  first he entered into the spirit of  our educational venture and has  been well known to every generation  of students who have come. Nearly  all have at one time or another  worked with him. He showed us  how to farm: how to plow and how  to harvest and everything in be­tween;  he taught us how to fire ~ ur  boilers, install and repair our heatmg  systems, plumbing, and the electric  wiring. He was always on the job,  and thou.,. h he showed many others o •  what to do, he always got an Im-mense  amount done himself. Some­times  we would ask him to meetings  4  where we hoped to get the work  better organized. He never was very  tolerant of too much talk, however,  and a familiar and often much ·  needed bit of advice from him was,  "" Let's stop talking and do some  work.""  THE COMMUNITY COUNCIL  Established last spring, the Com­munity  Council has two main func­tions.  First, to enable all community  members to share realistically in the  governing of the community. Second,  to thus free the faculty to con­centrate  its weekly meetings upon  matters of more direct academic or  educational concern.  Composed of representatives elected  from the students, faculty, staff mem­bers  and wives, the Community  Council operates under authority of  its own which was delegated to it by  the faculty. This means that the  total community now participates in  decisions on matters of concern to  the total community. Formerly, since  such authority resided in the faculty~  there was always the possibility of  the faculty over- ruling decisions of  the student government. Also the  staff members and the faculty wives  previously had no direct voice in  determining community policy.  At the present time the Community  Council is preparing a program of  community education which will  lead to a democratic decision by the  community as to how the emergency  buildings given us by the Federal  Government are to be utilized.  The personnel of the Community  Council is as follows:  REPRESENTING THE FACULTY  Mary Gregory  Johanna J alowetz  John Wallen ( Chairman)  REPRESENTING STAFF MEMBERS  AND FACULTY WIVES  Alice Rondthaler  REiPRESENTING THE STUDENTS  OIavi Sihvonen  Harry Weitzel'  Jose Yglesias ( Secretary)  REPRESENTATIVE AT LARGE  Suzanne Teasdale  HARRIETT ENGELHARDT  MEMORIAL COLLECTION  Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Engelhardt  of Birmingham, Alabama, parents of  Harriett Engelhardt, a student at  Black Mountain College in 1939,  have generously made a gift of $ 2, ­011.31,  the entire amopnt of Har­riett's  estate, to the College to be  used in memory of Harriett. She was  killed in Germany, October 26, 1945,  in a jeep accident, while serving  overseas with the American Red  Cross.  Part of the sum represents a contri­bution  by the Japanese American  522 Field Artillery Battalion with  whom Harriett had worked for  several months; part was a personal  gift of friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bernard  Lobman of Birmingham; the major  portion was what Harriett had saved  out of her earnings as an aeroplane  mechanic and Red Cross worker.  Since Harriett was especially inter­ested  in work in Weaving, the pro­ject  for this memorial will be a  collection of textiles to be known as  the Harriett Engelhardt Memorial  Collection. The material for this  memorial is to be collected under the  direction of Aimi Albers, adviser to  Harriett while she was at Black  Mountain College. In order to dis­play  the textiles, ancient and mad:  ern, part of the gift is to be used for  5  represent the student body on the  Senior Division Examinations Com­mittee.

DEMOCRACY AT  WORK AT HOME  Last month ten members of the  , lack Mountain College community  attended the Southern Negro Youth  Congress, held for three days in Co­lumbia,  S. C. Our delegation, an en­thusiastic  iota of the total 1200, re­turned  with a fortified sense of per­sonal  commitment to the aims of the  organization, which they communi­cated  to us all.  ANNUAL MEETING  OF THE FACULTY  The annual meeting of the faculty  of the Corporation of Black Moun­tain  College was held on Tuesday,  October 1. Theodore Dreier was  elected Rector of the College for the  year 1946- 47. At the same meeting  Theodore Rondthaler was elected to  the Board of Fellows for a three year  term; Albert William Levi, Edward  E. Lowinsky, and John L. Wallen,  for one year terms.  At a subsequent meeting of the Board  of Fellows, Albert William Levi was  elected Secretary and Theodore  Rondthaler Treasurer of the Cor­poration.  the purchase of exhibition show­cases.

And we  are prepared to accept contributions  to a piano fund, looking toward a  Steinway.  JOSEF ALBERS COMMENTS  ON THE SUMMER ART  INSTITUTE 1946  "" The third summer art institute  was held from July 2 to August 27.  Connected with it was a small sum­mer  work camp and so the campus  appeared very active. T~ e resul~ s  achieved may justify a belIef that It  was a successful summer.  "" Over one hundred inquiries were  received; fifty- two students were ac­cepted  for the full period.. These  with the work campers occupIed all  available space. Among the students  were three architects, four teachers  from colleges and art schools, and  three high school graduates. The  greater number were transfers from  other institutions, here for the sum­mer  session only. Seventeen were  regular Black Mountain College stu­dents.  Students enrolled from Can­ada  to Florida; from New York to  California. Among them were two  Negroes, one American- Japanese, and  one Chinese. Ten of the students  were GI's.  "" The excellent working spInt and  good results were due to our guest  teachers: Jean Varda of Monterey,  California, and Jacob Lawrence. of  New York City, each teaching pamt-ing  for the full eight weeks; Con­cetta  Scaravaglione of Sarah Law­rence  College and Leo Amino of  New York City, each teaching sculp­ture  for four weeks; Will Burtin of  New York City, Art Director of  Fortune and Leonard Lionni, Art  Directo; of N. W. Ayer & Son, Phila­delphia,  each lecturing on advertis-.  ing art for three weeks; Balcomb  Greene of Carnegie Institute of Tech­nology,  Pittsburgh, lecturing on the  history of painting, and Beaumont  Newhall, of the Museum of Modern  Art, lecturing on photography. Mem­bers  of the Black Mountain College  faculty who taught during the eight  weeks were Josef Albers, design and  color; Anni Albers, textile design;  Francisca Mayer, weaving; and Mary  Gregory, woodworking.

EDUCATION IN WARTIME  Black Mountain College has extended its curriculum and revised its calendar to meet the demands of the war. While the immediate and future need of educated citizens is more important than ever, the present demand for practical effectiveness and speed is also obvious. The accelerated program described below makes graduation possible in three years or less; students are to be encouraged to enter at as  young an age as is feasible; new courses both academic and practical provide training for immediate needs; and continued emphasis on a democratic way of life and on physical development builds the moral and physical stamina so essential to these times and to all times.    While adapting itself to the war effort the College retains the basic function of higher education as its major objective: training in thoughtful action, transmission and enhancement of our cultural  heritage, and development of a consciousness of those principles for which we are now struggling. The enormous social, economic, political, and ethical problems that the war brings with it - and which  the peace will render even more difficult - can be solved only through the application of deep understanding, imaginative intelligence, and true conviction. Education must prepare youth, young women as well as young men, to deal with these problems, to solve them. Wisdom cannot be improvised; good judgment requires a seasoned mind and disciplined feelings.    BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE BULLETIN August 1944  Volume II Number 8    Issued seven times a year, in August, September, November, December, January, February, and April. Entered as second-class matter, November 4, 1942, at the Postoffice at Black Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.    ACCELERATED PROGRAM  Under its war-time accelerated program the College operates on a system of four quarters per year of eleven weeks each. Under this plan students may come for either three or four quarters each year, but because of the war emergency they are encouraged to attend  four quarters and hasten their graduation. Students, as heretofore, will continue to graduate when they are prepared to do so, the average time being at the end of twelve quarters.    VETERANS' EDUCATION  The College expects to participate in the program of education for members of the armed services returning to civilian life, as pro­vided for in the Veterans' Rehabilitation bill ( Public Law 346) passed by Congress in June, 1944.    WORK-EXPERIENCE PROGRAM  In response to the present national demand for food production there is considerable emphasis upon farm work this year in the work program. This includes such work as the planting, tending, and harvesting of crops, and the clearing of forest land for pasture. In addition, experience leading to the acquirement of skills in building and construction and related to studies in architecture is obtainable through activities in connection with necessary main­tenance  and repair. Once a student's personal responsibility is es­tablished, leadership is developed through opportunities to direct individual projects which range from road building to operating the College Bookstore. These projects are open to men and women equally. An important element in such work is the development of  physical fitness. Members of the community now devote an average of three or four afternoons per week to this program.    ADMISSION TO STUDENT BODY  The College has never had fixed regulations concerning the age or scholastic background of applicants for admission, since it has pre­ferred to consider each individual case upon its merits. Although most applicants are of usual college age and have completed a four­ year course in accredited secondary schools, younger students, or students who have not finished secondary school, have been ad­mitted when their records indicated that they could carry college  work. Almost without exception such students have proved to be ready for college. In the present emergency the College will en­courage students of this kind to apply, provided their secondary school principals or headmasters recommend them for college en­trance  before graduation. Although the College knows that genuine    3    education cannot be accelcrated beyond a certain point, it does be­lieve that those who can procecd rapidly should be given the oppor­tunity to do so.    PAYMENT OF FEES  The yearly fee is payable as follows:    Full Fee Reduced Fee  Six weeks beforc beginning of term $200.00 $200.00  On entrance $ 400.00 Two-fifths of balance  Opening date of next quarter $ 400.00 Two-fifths of balance  Opening date of third quarter $ 200.00 The balance    The College cannot guarantee that a place will be reserved for any student after a date six weeks before the beginning of the term unless $200 has been deposited with the College by this time. This­ deposit  is not refundable except at Faculty discretion if the student withdraws after this date, since a withdrawal from a reserved place ­at the last moment may create a vacancy which otherwise would have been filled. When students are admitted after this date the deposit must be made within ten days of notification of acceptance  and before arrival.    If a student attends all four quarters in a given year, the extra fee for the fourth quarter is due as follows: one half of fee for this­ quarter thirty days prior to opening date of quarter; balance on opening date of quarter.    The only other fees are:  Application fee $5.00  Contingency deposit $25.00  Examination for graduation $25.00  Fee for late payment of any bill $10.00  The application fee must accompany application for admission to the College and is not refundable. Applicants who are accepted by the College should make the contingency deposit of $25 within ten  days of notification of acceptance, since admission does not become effective until this deposit is received. It is not refundable if the new student fails to enter. While a student is in attendance it must be maintained; but any unused portion of it is refunded upon graduation or withdrawal. Bills are payable on the date of the bill  and if not paid within ten days are subject to the fee for late pay­ment.    In cases where students are called into military service charges are made on an exact pro rata basis up to a week preceding the date of induction into the armed forces. Any amount in excess of this that has been paid is refunded. All future tuition payments although  contracted for are of course canceled.    4    The following courses were offered during 1943- 1944 and represent the area covered in a given year. The curriculum for 1944- 45 may be somewhat more limited than this, especially in the fall term, since several unexpected faculty replacements are having to be  made.

EGE BULLETIN Volume 6 Number 4  May 1948  Experiment in education by Jimmie Tile  "" We do not pretend to have the answers in matters of education; we are still  learning and experimenting, and it is my hope that we shall always be  thought of as an eXNrimental college,"" Bill Levi said at a recent community  meeting.  These sentiments are finding practical expression in a rather unique educa­tional  experiment this semester, which from all reports, seems to be working  out pretty well. For the first time courses are being offered by three student­teachers:  Art Penn, Harry Hall, and myself. Though by no means consid­ering  ourselves last - word authorities in our respective fields ( drama, sculp­ture,  printing), we three young men are drawing upon our own experience  in these arts. Calling on Penn the other day, I found him absorbed in his  well · worn handbook, An Actof Prepares, by Constantin Stanislavski. "" Each  time I read this,"" he told me, ""- and I think I've been through it a couple  of dozen times - I get new inspiration."" The idea I learned is to make act­ing  a creative rather than an interpretive art form. "" We try to deal within  the personal experience for the sources of creative acting instead of using  cliche images as is the case with the usual representational kind of acting.""  Art smdied at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Philadelphia in 1939 - 41 and'  had several seasons in summer stock. During the war he directed~ soldier  shows in Germany, liked it so well he remained in Europe a year following  ' his discharge, before enrolling at Black Moun, tain in the spring of 1947.  Students who take these informal courses do not receive transfer credits, but  are interested for a variety of other reasons.  Barry Hall in his pastoral studio up by the shop, adjacent to the forge, was  patiently hacking away at a granite block inscribed with the single word,  "" Een."" VA friendly tombstone carver in the next valley gave us a lot of ma­terial  from his quarry,"" he explained. "" The students begin by trying to work  out any ideas they have - no tombstones, though - and before long every­body  has some sort of trouble, and their troubles are usually similar. We look  for the cause, and in most cases we discover these three basic problems: 1.  Rard for them to see three- dimensionally; 2. Not able to handle the tools;  1  ..  3. Not being able to find forms that suit the material. Of course there are  other problems, but I think, · in the beginning, it is bener to concentrate less  on finished design and more on he nature of material and the proper hand­ling  of tools,"" Harry is quite tool- conscious, having learned to handle, to  make, and to respect them from early experience in his family's boatyard.  He worked for some time with Jose De Creeft before coming to Black  Mountain, and has been an active carver for many years. "" I've got a lot to  learn myself, but what I try to do is to set up situations by which students  can gain experience in the use of tools and materials. By situations I mean  posing problems which demand solutions. This sounds simple, but many  students don't see their obstacles as problems, and so no attempt to search  for more creative possibilities take place. Anyway, we enjoy working to­gether,  and I think we're all learning something,""  The resurrection of the print shop, its recent expansion, and its new press  are probably old news to most of you, but its original goals have not been  forgotten. The people in the course are learning the printing processes so that  they will be able to help with the college work as well as to see some of  . their own creative writing in print. The interest in such a course was so  great at the beginning of the term, that we had to divide the class into two  sections. Frank Rice meets with four people twice a week, and I have the  Tuesday and Friday group. My own knowledge and interest in printing de­veloped  while here on the campus. In the beginning there were only a few  of us, and we started from scratch; we made a lot of mistakes, not serious  ones, fortunately, but with patience and study we learned to avoid those mis­takes,  and I hope that we can help others avoid the same mistakes. Each  new job, whether it's a concert program, letterhead, or bulletin, presents a  different problem, and we go to work trying to solve it. It's pretty exciting  to see the first sheet come off the press. It also teaches a person a lot about  coordination and manual dexterity. I hope that eventually the shop will pos­..  Jess a Linotype machine. - J. T.  The Harriet Engelhardt Memorial Collection of Textll.  The first use which has been made of a new room for art classes in the "" Eye""  ( one of the government barracks), was appropriately for the purpose of a  textile exhibition. The textiles shown constitute the first part of a collection  made in memory of Harriet Engelhardt, a former student of Black Mountain  College who was especially interested in weaving.  Black Mountain College Bulletin  Volume 6 Number 4  May 1948  Issued seven times a year, in January, March, April, May, July, September and Novem­ber.  Entered as second- class matter November 4, 1942, at the Post Office at Black  Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.  2  Most of the pieces shown were collected by Anni Albers during her visit in  Mexico last year and originate therefore to a large extent from that coun­try.  Included in the collection ar~ . also pieces from Italy, Peru, Bolivia, tapa  cloth from the South Seas and three pieces of Egyptian mummy cloth, which  are of interest because of the fineness of threads and the closeness of weave.  It is a collection most varied in character. What all of these pieces have in  common is their close relationship between material, construction and de­sign,  all organically related to each other. This factor determined the choice  of the fabrics selected for this collection; it is one toward which we are also  striving.  Among the Mexican textiles are some small pieces, such as belts, scarfs, and  a charming head- piece, woven by the Chamula Indians. These materials are  more somber in color and coarser than most other pieces from Mexico be­cause  of the more severe climate in which these people live.  There is a little cross- stitched bag and some woven belts and purses by the  Huichol Indians which show remarkable skill and sense of design. An antique  silk serape, from a more northern region, is more striking because of its  strong figure- background design in black and white.  A small embroidery in black on a white background from Toluca is an  example of the insertion of threads in such a manner as to make them an  intricate part of the weave itself. There are a number of sashes with in­teresting  fringes, several belts woven in different techniques of double  weave, some ribbons to be braided into the hair of the Mexican women, all  of these in bright colors which catch the eye immediately.  An antique rebozo is especially fine in weave; the ends are finished to give  a lace- like appearance. In the entrance to the exhibition room is a rain coat  made out of long pointed palm leaves which overlap on the outside to shed  water and are knotted intricately on the inside. White tortilla cloths  show raised loops and fine lay- in work.  From Peru are three pre- Columbian pieces as well as several knitted caps  with gay figqres, a white wool blanket of silk- like quality with stripes in  multi- color.  A blanket very similar in its appearance is from Bolivia.  Two pieces in black and white are from Sardinia, Italy. Boldness of design  brings them' close to the Mexican textiles, even though they are more  sophisticated.  The exhibition has been arranged by Willie Joseph and Nancy Dunn. The  quietness which has been achieved in the placement of these textiles brought  out each piece, despite the great variety.  3  We admire these textiles for their craftsmanship and artistic val~ e, but what  is even more important is the stimulation they will give to some, opening  new ways in the use of materials and tools.  The collection will be availablel to students who specialize in the study of  textiles. We hope that this exh'' bition marks the beginning of a collection  which will continue to grow.  Campus news  Black Mountain College bought its present property in 1937 from the estate  of E, W. Grove, a former Asheville business man who had developed it as a  1  family summer resort, "" Lake Eden Inn,"" The purchase price was $ 36,240.48.  Approximately half this sum waJ paid in cash through gifts from friends of  the college; the remaining portion, $ 17,500, was borrowed from the Grove  Estate itself, and the total proper, ty of the college was mortgag~ d as security  for the loan. During the ten years since then, again through the help of  friends and well- wishers, annual payments of one to rwo- and- a- half thousand  dollars have steadily sliced this d~ bt away, Last month, April 20 to be exact,  came the day when it was possible to send the last check to the offices of the  Grove Estate and to receive in exchange the final note marked ''' Paid in full""  md the mortgaged deed to the property also marked "" Fully paid and satisfied,""  It is true that there remains an external ' indebtedness ( for improvements to  the property) of $ 10,000, previously held under second mortgage, now ad­vanced  to first mortgage position, and payable at $ 1,000 a year for 10 years.  But this scarcely dims the satisfaction of having at least the original debt  against the purchase of the propekty now fully paid and erased.  \  . Josef Albers was juror for the awards at the Society oJ Washing, to~ Artists,  . Washington, D, C, in April. He has been elected a member of he com­I?  mittee on architecture, painting and sculpture of the University Council,  Yale University. At its first meeting, held April 24 and 25, at Yale, the  committee discussed plans for the reorganization of the Fine Arts Depart­ment  at the University.  Natasha Goldowski, teacher of physics and chemistry at BMC, attended the  meeting of the eastern division of the National Physics Society at Oak Ridge,  early in April, and later in the month, that of the American Physics Society  in Washington, D. C. I  Dr. Nathan Rosen, formerly of tne faculty of Black Mountain College, now  professor of physics at the University of North Carolina, visited BMC for  a weekend in April. He talked to the community on the subject of Nuclear  Disintegration.  4  John Cage and Merce Cunningham visited Black Mountain College in April.  John Cage composes music. He is a young man and he writes music for the  piano transformed into a combination of percussive sound and tone. This  transformation is brought about by the insertion of a certain number of  bolts, screws, and leather scraps into the piano. He played for the college  community a program of sixteen sonatas and four interludes, the work  largely of the last rwo years. After the program, and after coffee in the  community house, John Cage answered the questions of those who wondered  what he meant to be doing and why he was doing it. He suggested that he  was interested more in time than in harmonics. His music is structured  according to duration in time, every smaller unit of a large composition re­flecting  as a microcosm the features of the whole. He said that he felt that  the highest use of music was like that of anything a man "" makes"": to inte­grate  a man's total faculties through the order of the composition. Primarily  the work performs this function for its creator, but the nice thing about  "" art"" ( anything a man "" makes"") is that it may have the same power for  another - a creative performer or audience. And, since integration may  recognize itself in a stranger, a new society may one day slowly take shape  out of the present schizophrenia through our self- won coordination. It begins  with music and ends with a common human nature.  Or, say, with the d~ nce. Merce Cunningham is a dancer, composing, perform­ing,  teaching. Like Cage his interest is now mainly in time, movement in  time, rather than poses. Cunningham and Cage work together, or perhaps  one should say separately. Actually they work out the dance and music  separately after having agreed upon a rhythmic structure. This permits  freedom of invention equally, within known limits, and prevents the con­ventional  synchronization of gesture and tone. Merce Cunningham gave  for the community a program of dance exercises and dance compositions.  It was a very beautiful and powerful expression of spiritual concentration  rna ~ ifested in movement. He also worked with students while he was here.  )  Consonant with their humility before the act of making something orderly  and expressive of a total human being, these two artists made little of their  biographies. Somehow they were both at one time students at the Cornish  School in Seattle. After that, John Cage travelled in Europe, studied with  Schoenberg and in California with Cowell. Merce Cunningham danced with  Martha Graham for six years, and then he moved into independent work.  They are at present on tour, meeting invitations extended to them in  Chicago, Wisconsin, Los Angeles, San Francisco. They will return to Black  Mountain College for the summer session.  The current of creative energy since their visit has illuminated the college  both in creation and in response.  5  •  News of former students  Morris 1.

Jan.  . Kpr.  July  Newsletter  EDUCATION IN WARTIME  Black Mountain College has extended its curriculum and  revised its calendar to meet the demands of the war.  "" While the immediate and future need of educated citi ·  zens is more important than ever, the present demand  for practical effectiveness and speed is also obvious. The  accelerated program described below makes graduation  possible in three years or less; students are to be en ·  couraged to enter at as young an age as is feasible; new  courses both academic and practical provide training for  immediate needs; and continued emphasis on a demo­cra~  ic way of life and on physical development builds the  moral and physical stamina so essential to these times and  to all times.  While adapting itself to the war effort the College retains  the basic function of higher education as its major ob ·  jective: training in thoughtful action, transmission and  enhancement of our cultural heritage, and development  of a consciousness of those principles for which we are  now struggling. The enormous social, economic, politi;: al,  and ethical problems that the war brings with it - and  which the peace will render even more difficult - can be  solved only through the application of deep understand­ing,  imaginative intelligence, and true conviction. Educa­tion  must prepare youth, young women as well as young  men, to deal with these problems, to solve them. Wisdom  cannot he improvised; good judgment requires a seasoned  mind and disciplined feelings.  Black Mountain College Bulletin  Special Issue for July, 1945.  Issued seven times a year, in August, September, November,  December, January, February and April. Entered as second- ·  class matter November 4, 1942,' at the Postoffice at Black  Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.  3  ACCELERATED PROGRAM  Under its war- time accelerated program the College  operates on Ii system of four quarters per year of eleven  weeks each. Under this plan students may come for either  three or four quarters each year, but because of the war  emergency they are encouraged to attend four quarters  and hasten their graduation. Students, as heretofore, will  continue to graduate when they are prepared to do so,  the average time being at the end of twelve quarters.  VETERANS' EDUCATION  The College expects to participate in the program of edu­cation  for members of the armed services returning to  civilian life, as provided for in the Veterans' Rehabilita­tion  Bill ( Public Law 346) passed by Congress in June,  1944.  COMMUNITY WORK PROGRAM  In response to the present national demand for food pro­duction  there is considerable emphasis upon farm work  this year in the work program. This includes such work  as the planting, tending, and harvesting of crops, and the  clearing of forest land for pasture. In addition, experi­ence  leading to the acquirement of skills in building and  construction and related to studies in architecture is ob­tainable  through activities in connection with necessary  maintenance and repair. Once a student's personal re­sponsibility  is established, leadership is developed through  opportunities to direct individual projects which range  from road building to operating the College Bookstore.  These projects are open to men and women equally. An  important element in such work is the development of  physical fitness. Members of the community now devote  an average of three or four afternoons per week to this  program.  ADMISSION TO: STUDENT BODY  The College has never had fixed regulations concerning  the age or scholastic background of applicants for ad­mission,  since it has preferred to consider each individual  case upon its merits. Although most applicants are of  usual college age and have completed a four- year course  in accredited secondary schools, younger students, or stu­dents  who have not finished secondary school, have been  admitted when their records indicated that they could  carry college work. Almost without exception such stu­dents  have proved to be ready for college. In the present  emergency the College will encourage students of this  kind to apply, provided their secondary school principals  or headmasters recommend them for college entrance  before graduation. Although the College knows that gen­uine  education cannot be accelerated beyond a certain  point, it does believe that those who can proceed rapidly  should be given the opportunity to do so.  4  PAYMENT OF FEES  The yearly fee is payable as follows:  Full Fee Reduced Fee  Six weeks before beginning of term $ 200.00 $ 200.00  On entrance $ 400.00 2/ 5 of balance  Opening date of next quarter '$ 400.00 2/ 5 of balance  Opening date of third quarter $ 200.00 The balance  The College cannot guarantee that a place will be reo  served for any student after a date six weeks before the  beginning of the term unless $ 200.00 has been deposited  with the College by this time. This deposit is not refund­able  except at Faculty direction if the student withdraws  after this date, since a withdrawal from a reserved place  at the last moment may create a vacancy which otherwise  would have been filled. When students are admitted after  this date the deposit must be made within ten days of  notification of acceptance and before arrival.  If a student attends all four quarters in a given year, the  extra fee for the fourth quarter is due as follows: one · half  of fee for this quarter thirty days prior to opening date  of quarter; balance on opening date of quarter.  The only other fees are:  Application fee $ 5.00  Contingency deposit $ 25.00  Examination for graduation $ 25.00  Fee for late payment of any bill $ 10.00  The application fee must accompany application for ad ·  mission to the College and is not refundable. Applicants  who are accepted by the College should make the con ·  tingency deposit of $ 25.00 within ten days of notification  of acceptance, since admission does not become effective  until this deposit is received. It is not refundable if the  new student fails to enter. While a student is in attend­ance  it must be maintained; but any unused portion of it  is refunded upon graduation or withdrawal. Bills are pay­able  on the date of the bill and if not paid within ten  days are subject to the fee for late payment.  In cases where students are called into military service  charges are made on an exact pro rata basis up to a week  preceding the date of induction into the armed forces.  Any amount in excess of this that has been paid is re­funded.  All future tuition payments although contracted  ' for are of course canceled.  COURSES  The following courses were offered during the first three  quarters of the 1944- 45 Session and represent, in a some­what  limited way, the area covered in a given year. The  curriculum for 1945- 46 will be much less limited than  this, since additions will be made to the Faculty.  For other courses that may be available, consult the  College catalogue. Courses are given when there is suffi­cient  demand for them. Tutorials for advanced students  are given when need arises, and are not listed below.  5  ARTS  Drawing  Painting  Design  Beginning Weaving  Advanced Weaving  Verse Writing  Introductory Writing  Playwriting  Dramatic Production  Journalism  Rhythm and Melody  Counterpoint  Elements of Form and Structure  in Music  Vienncse School of Music after  Beethoven  Chorus  Ensemble  Violin  Piano  Woodworking  House Design - Plan Analysis  House Design - Fundamentals  of Construction  Elementary Architectural Draw­ing  LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE  American Literature  Modern Poetry  Elementary French  Intermediate French  German for Beginners  Herman Melville: An Introduc­tion  to American Writing  William Blake and the Ro-mantic  Period in England  Greek Tragedy  Greek Comedy  Moliere and Contemporaries  Medireval Drama  Bible  MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE  Calculus  Introductory Mathematics  Basic Mathematics  Matter and Energy  Biology  SOCIAL STUDIES  History of the United States  Cultural Anthropology  Social Problems  Social Change  Economics  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, sprmg  Winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, sprin~  Winter  Fall, winter  Fall  Fall  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, sprin~  Winter, spring  Fan, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Spring  Fall, winter, spring  W"" inter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Winter, spring  Winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Fall  Fall  Fall  Winter  Winter  Fall  Winter, spring  Fall, winter, spring  Winter, spring  Spring  Fall, winter, spring  Spring  F all, winter  Spring  Fall, winter  Spring  Winter, spring  Psychodynamics of Creativity  Culture of the Renaissance  Dialogues of Plato  Outline of Western Culture  SUMMER SESSIONS  Fall, winter, spring  Winter, fall  Winter, spring  Spring  6  Since Pearl Harbor Black Mountain College has been at  work all year round, and the Summer Quarter which was  an innovation has become an institution. In summer the  normal life of the College continues~ though with a partly  changed personnel. Hence the summer is a time when  students may tryout Black Mountain College, and when  Black Mountain College may try out students. After at­tending  the Summer Session out of curiosity or more or  less casual interest many students have remained as reg­ular  members of the College community.  The chief items on the summer schedule this year are  courses offered by Music and Art Institutes.  The staff for the Black Mountain College 1945 Summer  Art Institute includes: Dr Walter Gropius, founder and  first director of the Bauhaus in Germany and the present  head of the Department of Architecture at Harvard Uni­versity;  Lyonel Feininger and Fannie Hillsmith, painters;  Ossip Zadkine and Mary Callery, sculptors; Paul Rand  and Alvin Lustig, advertising artists; F W Goro, scientific  photographer on the staff of Life magazine; Berta Rudof­sky,  designer, leather work; and Dr Alexander Dorner  and Dr Karl With, art historians and art theorists.  Anni Albers, a member of the Art Department of Black  Mountain College, will give a course in textile design.  Josef Albers, the head of the Art Department of the  College, will give courses in basic design and color. Paul  Beidler, the College architect, will give a course in archi­tecture.  During the Institute the practicing classes will be open to  art teachers and art students, beginners as well as ad­vanced  students. Lectures will be given periodically for  the whole College Community and for the general public.  Various exhibitions will accompany the lectures and  classes in which modern teaching methods will be stressed.  Running concurrently with the Art Institute will be a  Second Summer Music Institute, under the direction of  the College Music Department.  The guest faculty for the Music Institute includes: Erwin  Bodky, pianist and harpsichordist of the Cambridge Col­legium  Musicum, a member of the faculty of the Longy  School of Music; Carol Brice, concert contralto; Frances  Snow Drinker, flutist, formerly a member of the faculty  of the University of Louisville; Dr Alfred Einstein, music  historian at Smith College and the author of Mozart: His  Character and Work; Roland Hayes, concert tenor; Eva  Heinitz, assistant first cellist of the Pittsburgh Symphony  Orchestra; Hugo Kaudel', composer of many works for  different instrumental and vocal ensembles; Josef Marx,  oboist and English horn player in the Metropolitan Opera  Company; William Valkenier, first horn player of the  Boston Symphony Orchestra; and Emanuel Zetlin, asso­ciate  concert- master of the Metropolitan Opera Company  and a member of the faculty of the Manhattan School of  Music.  Through the courtesy of Music Mountain of Falls Village,  Connecticut, the Gordon String Quartet will be a part of  the Institute for the last three weeks of the summer pro­gram.  The quartet will give a series of six concerts of  classic and contemporary music.  The Music Institute will feature music lectures, tutorials,  open rehearsals, concerts, and courses on the rise and de­velopment  of vocal and instrumental polyphony with spe­cial  emphasis on the small ensembles of chamber music.  The concerts, lectures and classes of the Music Institute  will be open to the stridents and teachers of the Art  Institute.  Students of the Black Mountain College Summer Session  may enroll in any music and art classes for which they  are qualified. They may also attend all lectures and extra­curricular  events.  7  ART INSTITUTE 1945  Advertising  Architecture  Architecture  Art History  Art History and Theory  Basic Design  Color  Contemporary Art  Graphic Design  Leatherwork  Painting  Painting  Painting and Composition  Photography  Sculpture  Sculpture  Textile Design  Woodworking  MUSIC INSTITUTE 1945  A Capella Chorus  Bach's Work for the Violin  Chamber Orchestra  Collegium Musicum  Creative Music Education  The Literature of the Viola da  Gamba and the ' Cello  Polyphony Through the Ages  Paul Rand  Paul Beidler  Walter Gropius  Karl With  Alexander Dorner  Josef Albers  Josef Albers  Robert Motherwell  Alvin Lustig  Berta Rudofsky  Lyonel Feininger  Robert Motherwell  Fannie Hillsmith  F.

Issued seven times a year, in August, September, November, December, January, February and April. Entered as second­class matter November 4, 1942, at the Postoffice at Black Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.    The public interest in art is spreading steadily. Art books  have become best sellers. Art museums have gained an  attendance not dreamed of before. Neither war nor trans­portation difficulties have affected the increasing number of gallery visitors. The Saturday art workshops for chil­dren at the museums are overcrowded and the waiting lists are expanding.    Few schools and colleges offered art courses ten years ago. Today, art in education is advancing from the status of extra-curricular activity to that of an accepted field of study, even to a central part of the curriculum. Today, students major in art, do graduate work and achieve doc­tor's degrees in the practice of art and in theory.    It is easy to recognize that such a broad educational in­terest in art can not be satisfied by art history and art  appreciation. Thus practicing studio- classes are increas­ing. The growing number of artists- in- residence shows  that a direct contact with the artist and his personal in­fluence are demanded.    We are on the way, therefore, toward correcting mistakes of the past still prevailing in both art conservation and education.    In education it has become evident that a one- sided em­phasis on intellectual development is as wrong as it is  undemocratic. It neglects the visual, accoustical, and  manual type of student, thereby losing technical and  artistic abilities and talents.    For a long time, we have left the care and publication of  works of art, as well as judgment and criticism, mainly to the historian. This is one reason why old art stands in  the foreground of interest, why we lose relationship with  contemporary art and living artists.    More and more, however, the artist is recognized as com­petent to represent his own field. Today, he is permitted, even urged, to write and to speak on art and art theory, on his own work and himself. Once more he is considered the natural and able judge and interpreter of art. He may tend to subjective evaluations, but any objective estimate has become questionable, since we realize a continual change of taste and appreciation.    All these changes are significant for our cultural develop­ment. They reveal an awareness of cultural needs and  obligations. They demonstrate also that the producer of  art deserves our concern as much as his product. And, he who influences artistic development will inevitably influ­ence art education and, through this, general education.

GENERAL INFORMATION  Black Mountain College is situated in the heart of the  Great Cragyy Mountains of Western North Carolina, a  section noted for its climate and scenery. Because of the  altitude - 2,400 feet - the summers are usually cool,  particularly at night. The College campus with its farm  and a little lake is just off US Highway 70, three miles  from the town of Black Mountain. The railroad station  Black Mountain in on the scenic Southern Railroad Line  from Salisbury to Abheville. Direct Pullman cars from  New York to Black Mountain. The City of Asheville is  fifteen miles from the College.    The lake is bordered on the south by the dinin/!; hall,  with a dining porch; on the north, by the new studies  building erected with student and faculty labor. The  living quarters of the College students include two dormi­tory buildings with bedrooms for two, three and more persons.    Members of the Black Mountain College community take  care of their own rooms.    At Black Mountain College teachers and students live on  the campus. They have their meals together in the dining hall. Thus there is a constant personal contact among stu­dents and teachers.    The College farm supplies milk, meat, and vegetables to  the College kitchen.    The College community life in summer offers opportuni­ties for dancing, picnics, light farm work, hiking, and  swimming.    Clothing appropriate for walking in the mountains and  for working outdoors should be provided, as well as ordi­nary city clothes suitable for this climate. Evening  dresses are worn at dances and concerts.    Students are asked to bring with them the art materials  and stools which they wish to use. Only a few materials  are obtainable at the College co-operative store; paints,  canvas, special papers, etc., only in limited choice and  quantities at Asheville stores. Light easels are provided  by the College.    ADMISSION  Admission to the Art Institute rests with a College com­mittee. Its decisions depend upon active interest, ability,  artistic training. There are no regulations as to educa­tional background and age.    The filled-out application blank (attached) should be  accompanied by an application fee of $5.00. This fee, non-    10    refundable, will be credited to the inclusive fee upon  admission. The Committee will write directly to the refer­ences given.    For application for a scholarship, an additional special  form to be filled out will be sent upon request.    Because of limited accommodations, applications for ad­mission should be mailed as early as possible.    FEE  The fee for attendance at the Art Institute, summer 1945, during the full period of ten weeks is four hundred dol­lars. This amount includes all charges for tuition, lectures, use of College libraries, record collection and equipment, visiting of classes and lectures of the regular College sum­mer session, the Music Institute, and room and board.    Although participants for the full period will receive  first consideration, participants for shorter periods will  be accommodated if space remains available. The charge for shorter periods will be: fifty dollars per week for a period of three to six weeks; forty- five dollars per week for a period of more than six weeks. Normally no one will be admitted for less than three weeks. The fee is payable as follows: twenty- five percent upon notice of  admission, to insure reservation of accommodation; the  balance on arrival.    A limited number of scholarships is available to talented  students, artists and teachers to help them defray part of tuition costs for the Art Institute. Scholarships will be  available only to those who can show that they are in  need of financial support.    For further information write to the Registrar, Black  Mountain College, Black Mountain, North Carolina.    SCHEDULE  As the time-table on Page 11 shows, class and lecture  courses are so arranged in time that the various fields  and the teachers are distributed as equally as possible  over the whole session of ten weeks.    The schedule will be arranged in such a way that directed class work will take place in the mornings ( Painting, Sculpture, Advertising, Basic Design, Textile Design, Color).    The afternoons will be reserved for rest, private work,  outdoor activities, workshop, voluntary participation in  the College Work Program, also for individual advice  and criticism.    Lectures and discussions will usually be held in the  evenings.    At the end of a course there will be an exhibition of  work done in the course.    Students are advised not to take more than three courses at a time (not counting lectures) in order to insure in­tensified study.    10    TIMETABLE  JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER  TEXTILE DESIGN  BASIC DESIGN  COLOR  ARCHITECTURE  WOODWORKING  PAINTING  SCULPTURE  LEATHER WORK  ART HISTORY  PAINTING  ART HISTORY  GRAPHIC DESIGN  ARCHITECTURE  SCULPTURE  PAINTING  PHOTOGRAPHY  ADVERTISING - ART  2--- 9 9-- 14 16-- 21 23- 28 30-- 4 6-- 11 13-- 18 20- 25 27-- 1 3--- 8    ALBERS, A.

It is uncertain whether these ctions represent in every case the general  policy of the institution in relation to Black Mountain College credits, or  whether the policy varies with the individual circumstances. The latter  seems to be sometimes true since two students have had different degrees of  success in transferring to the s~ e' college.

Following the advice  of his physician Dr. Schmidt to spare  his hearing as much as possible  Beethoven moved to the village of  Heiligenstadt, near Vienna. Ferdinand  Ries, his piano pupi1 during 1802 reports:  ""He lived much in the country whither I  went often to take a lesson from him.  At times, after breakfast he would say  ""Let us take a short walk."" We went and  frequently did not return till 3 or 4  o'clock, after having made some meal in  some village. On one of these wanderings  Beethoven gave me the first striking  proof of his loss of hearing, concern-ing  which St. von Breuning had already  spoken to me.

Entered as second-class matter November 4, 1942, at the Post Office at Black Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.    The public interest in art is spreading steadily. Art books  have become best sellers. Art museums have gained an  attendance not dreamed of before. Neither war nor trans­portation difficulties have affected the increasing number of gallery visitors. The Saturday art workshops for chil­dren at the museums are overcrowded and the waiting lists are expanding.    Few schools and colleges offered art courses ten years ago. Today, art in education is advancing from the status of extra-curricular activity to that of an accepted field of study, even to a central part of the curriculum. Today, students major in art, do graduate work and achieve doc­tor's degrees in the practice of art and in theory.    It is easy to recognize that such a broad educational in­terest in art can not be satisfied by art history and art  appreciation. Thus practicing studio-classes are increas­ing. The growing number of artists-in-residence shows  that a direct contact with the artist and his personal in­fluence are demanded.    We are on the way, therefore, toward correcting mistakes of the past still prevailing in both art conservation and education.     In education it has become evident that a one- sided em­phasis on intellectual development is as wrong as it is  undemocratic. It neglects the visual, accoustical, and  manual type of student, thereby losing technical and  artistic abilities and talents.    For a long time, we have left the care and publication of  works of art, as well as judgment and criticism, mainly to the historian. This is one reason why old art stands in  the foreground of interest, why we lose relationship with  contemporary art and living artists.    More and more, however, the artist is recognized as com­petent to represent his own field. Today, he is permitted, even urged, to write and to speak on art and art theory, on his own work and himself. Once more he is considered the natural and able judge and interpreter of art. He may tend to subjective evaluations, but any objective estimate has become questionable, since we realize a continual change of taste and appreciation.    All these changes are significant for our cultural develop­ment. They reveal an awareness of cultural needs and  obligations. They demonstrate also that the producer of  art deserves our concern as much as his product. And, he who influences artistic development will inevitably influ­ence art education and, through this, general education.

COURSES  LECTURES  PANELS  DRAWING  PAINTING    JEAN CHARLOT   A class of combined drawing and painting from nature,  as a discipline in seeing - illustrating with the model  the grammar of lines and colors, rhythms, balances, static and dynamic elements observed in their pure state in the composition class ( see below). The drawing - painting class also will disclose natural sources of styles, i. e. primi­tive, baroque, etc, that are incipient in natural vision.  - 3 mornings weekly-    COMPOSITION  JEAN CHARLOT   Static: In two dimensions, harmonious with regard to  area covered. In three dimensions, creation of limited  space in which solids are defined by three co-ordinates  as opposed to unlimited spatial sensation with its ro­mantic or impressionistic connotations.  Dynamic: The addition to the three dimensions of an­other, that of time-movement. Multiple images and re­lation of the cinematographic to the static in composite  images.  Perspective and point of view: From the Italian per­spective with single point of view to mural problems, in­cluding multiple point of view, diagonal vision, both  lateral and vertical. - 1 morning weekly-    7     GENERAL DESIGN  JOSEF ALBERS   Study of fundamental problems underlying all art: Exer­cises in material will lead through producing form to  reading of the meaning of form. Form depends basically  on construction and combination, that is on capacity and  appearance of material. We study activity related to  quantity and intensity ( proportion), to movement ( dy­namic - static), to three- and two-dimensionality ( vol­ume - space and shape), to tension ( contrast · affinity, ex­ception and parallelism), to placement ( figure - back­ground problem).  Color problems of design are studies in a special course.  ( See Color). - 1 morning weekly-    COLOR  JOSEF ALBERS  Color and how it works. Color is the most relative  medium in art. Its application is primarily a psycho­logical  prohlem. Experimental studies will demonstrate  how color changes color in its various properties. The  main color activities, such as color-intensity and light­intensity, depend, e. g., on quantity, shape, placement.  Space in color, and color in space. Color opaque, trans­lucent, transparent. Color mixture, subtractive and addi­tive. The Weber- Fechner Law. Color systems, their pur­pose and use. - 1 morning weekly-    TEXTILE DESIGN  ANNI ALBERS  Construction of fabrics, theoretically and practically, in  classes and weaving workshop. Analysis of fabrics. De­signing, on the loom, for industrial production and weav­ing of individual pieces. Work with primitive looms ( for  the teaching of weaving in schools with limited equip­ment and for those interested in the study of some ancient techniques) . - 4 mornings weekly-    SCULPTURE  JOSE DE CREEFT   Creative work in form of direct carving.  - 3 mornings weekly-    WOOD PLASTIC  JAMES PRESTINI   Hand and machine sculpture in wood. Demonstrations  and practice: hand and machine tools; wood and wood  finishes, plywood, bent wood; shaping exercises, using  saws, drills, lathe, sander, etc.; surface treatments.  - Instruction by appointment-    PHOTOGRAPHY  JOSEPH BREITENBACH   Instruction in photography suitable for the professional  or non-professional photographer, also for those inter­ested in artistic and commercial manifestation. Six lec­tures dealing with fundamental aspects: Reality and Personality ( Document- Creation) / Trannsformation of Space    8    (Three- and Two-Dimensionality) / Transformation of Color (Visual-Pictorial Contrasts) / Transformation of Time (Action-Activity / Applications (Reportage, Advertising, Portrait) / Experimental Photos / History of Photography. Exhibition with analysis. -Instruction by appointement-    BARBARA MORGAN  Will demonstrate, discuss, and criticize photography. Two illustrated lectures on Photographic Vision and Control of Elements and Technique in Photographic Expression. -Instruction by appointment-    Students interested in photography are requested to bring equipment for practical studies and previous work for criticism.  The College provides darkroom with modest equipment.    CLOTHING  BERNARD RUDOFSKY  Themes for discussion: Man's unwillingness to accept the anatomic form of the human body as satisfactory and definite. Topography of modesty. Corporal decoration among primitive and civilized peoples. Contemporary dress: anachronistic, irrational, impractical, harmful. Symbols and vestiges. Dress dictating our behavious, dominating and conditioning all phases of life.  Demonstrations: Critical examination of own clothes. Students asked to draw pattern of the garments they are wearing in order to make them realize all their absurdities. Uncut types of clothes improvised by students. Headgear and footwear investigated. Relationships stressed: foot - footwear - floor -plan.  Mr. Rudofsky, in manual studies, will be assisted by Mrs. Rudofsky, who will give practical advice in the making of clothing and accessories in various techniques.

Because of the  altitude - 2,400 feet - the summers are usually cool,  particularly at night. The College campus with its farm  and a little lake is just off US Highway 70, three miles  from the town of Black Mountain. The railroad station  Black Mountain is on the scenic Southern Railroad Line  from Salisbury to Asheville. Direct Pullman cars from  New York to Black Mountain. The city of Asheville is  fifteen miles from the College.    The lake is bordered on the south by the dining hall,  with a dining porch; on the north, by the new studies  building erected with student and faculty labor. The  living quarters of the College students include two dormi­tory buildings with bedrooms for two, three and more persons.    Members of the Black Mountain College community take  care of their own rooms.    At Black Mountain College teachers and students live on  the campus. They have their meals together in the dining hall. Thus there is a constant personal contact among stu­dents and teachers.    The College farm supplies milk, meat, and vegetables to  the College kitchen.    The College community life in summer offers opportuni­ties for dancing, picnics, light farm work, hiking, and  swimming.    Clothing appropriate for walking in the mountains and  for working outdoors should be provided, as well as ordi­nary city clothes suitable for this climate. Evening dresses are worn at dances and concerts.    Students arc asked to bring with them the artists' ma­terials which they wish to use. A few materials are ob­tainable at the College co- operative store; paints, canvas, special papers, etc., at Asheville stores. Light easels are provided by the College.

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT ( My Day, April 10, 1941.)    Black Mountain is a living example of democracy in  action. JOHN DEWEY.    I want to congratulate you upon the work you are doing.  You are here as a little community to work with your  hands and your brains, which is a good thing for you.  What is done out of pleasure is much better done than  what is done out of duty. If you had to climb mountains  out of duty, you could not mount these high mountains.  I think that is also true with the high mountains of the  spirit. ALBERT EINSTEIN.    Progressive education's most famous outpost.  Time Magazine, Dec. 27, 1943.    There should be at least one college such as this in every state, operated independently of the big universities, to provide custom-tailored education for those who want it and do the experimenting of which the big schools are almost incapable.

Any resemblance to a conununity bulletin,  l± ving or dead, is entirely coincidental. F~ r~ hermore, this is NOT Bodoni type.  New Year's Dc. y at BMC is rainy with a threat of sleet if it continues to get  colder, as the weather man predicts it will. The rock walk to the dining hall  squirts muddy water upward; brown rivers follow the roadway from, the Studie s  Building; the mountains are obscure in heavy mist. It's a dreary day outside,  "" but I see a cardinal in the tree near We, ll en' s.  We all ( that I s Sou. thern, like "" you all"") he re at BMC have had a grand vacation.  It has been grand from the very day when the bus left for Washington and the  Bolotowsky car left for New York ( sorry about the puncture, Ilya; we heard about  it from the Niebyls) and Williams and Bergman, Inc. left for Chicago ( pardon me,  Hank, Beaver Dam). But we are beginning to miss all of you. Lore, it was good  of you to write and ask when college opens; ( in case others don't know, classes  begin at 8: 30 a~ m. Wednesday, January 8; we expect most of you on January 7  and will welcome you back with spaghetti for lunch and hamburger for supper).  And Hank, it was good of you to write for your ration book, which was probably  in JOhn's pocket. And Pepe it was go od of you to writ e for more money,  eSp3cially since you wanted to buy your mother a Christllll3. s present. All such  messages are welCOI1B by those of us shut out of the world in this rainy little  mountain valley.  Hitting the high- spots of the holiday at BMC  I. Our new Caroling Group. Them3 song: "" Christmas is coming,  The Goose is getting fat;  Please to put a penny  In the old rran's hat.""  A delightful round inaugurat ed by John Wallen, with Molly as of i'icial  starter, and the rest jining inl Christmas Eve about fourteen of us sung carols,  incluii: 1g the round, at Oteen Annex ( formerly Moore General Hospital). While  Bobbie, Franziska, arrl Evelyn hurried around handing out song sheets to the  patients and asking them to join in the' singing, Molly pitched the tune ( once or  twic e) then Rondy and John picked it up, and by that time the three pap3r girls  were back and everyone got in on the second line. We sang in about twelve wards  and considering our age, ' we kept fairly well on the key to the bitter er. d ( not  quite as well as doe s the barber shop quartet -- boys, they want you to come  down s ometfure! ); anyway, our spirits were go od, and after it was aver we got  more sp irits at the Elliott Merricks.  2. Santa Claus; single or plural? There was a lot of discussion the day  before Christmas'about Santa Claus -- whether he "" TaS or wasn't; whether he'was  single or plural, etc., etc. Faf said NO to everything; blt Asawa said YES, so  in"" the end the stockings were hung'by the fireplace with care"" in South Lcxl. gf?,  and Santa did corre, and in the end, tlhat is beforemorn: ing, there were five  San tas at W) rk and the stockings were found at daybreak-- filled-- vvith left- overs  in a corner for the unbelievers ( Al fouhd th ese). Like Morton Salt "" It never  rains but it pours If, so ' Wi.. th the Santas. Two of them were seen by inquisitive  members of the community at midnight in South Lodge; three were heard and seen  in the early morning hours between 4: 30 and 6 a. m. Faculty homes were  ruthlessly ent ered ( but no faculty were carried away). The Wallen I s felt the  chill of the night air as their living room door was opened and closed; the  Rondys heard the thud as one Santa fell headlong over their faithful watchdog,  Jake, asleep in the hallway; the Levi's were awakened by the giggling caroling;  the Niebyls slept throu gh it; Molly was semi- cons cious of the int ru sien; as for  Eddie Lowinsky, he knew it was burglars climbi: 1g in the window ( moral, Eddie,  never lock the doors on Christmas Eve). Dayliftit brrnght the evidence -- huge,  ginger cookies in queer shapes -- trains, cows, horses, faces with cow- catcher  whiske rs ( goo ss whos e)- all fourrl.- on table s and chairs' in the faculty households.  But at breakfast at nine, there were no Santas presEnt.  3. Forwarding Mail. This VlaS B's job. She did an especially good job on  mail going to TampS; F1or: ida, and Crewe, Virginia. Forwarding mail is a tricky  job, especially when we cbn't mve anyfoI""' flarding, addresses! We did know Neil  was in New York, but we werenit sure of Dan Rice's address, but we hope he got  all of his mil. Reading the postcards was exciting; but there weren't enough  of them. Wondering what was in too Christmas packages was exciting ani we'll  be hanging around when Susie Teasdale opens those wonderful pears and Dan opens  the box of dates from California.. We might even hang arourrl mEn Squeaky opens  his big DoX of kapok sleeping bags. We tried to get Charlie Boyce' s packa~ e  threugh to France -- we knew about the girl there ( maybe it was Gennany), but  in spit e' of Ed Adamy's declaration s, the package came back a third time aJmd is  here now, so Charlie is "" alone in the pines, where the cold wind blOWS"" so far  as that r: articular girl is cencerned.  - 2 -  4.

There is still a car of LUMP  to come - about January 8 -_. start planning M3I1vel and pm:. us on the sid el1ne sl  50 Governm: n, t emirs. It was a bright, sunny day when Mrs. Rondy first,  sighted the goverL'uent r; hairs dO'ffi under the stu- d. ie S ;' Jl::. i. ldlng wall in tnE' mdI'sh  ne.:, c · the lake.

If  "" Oh, hanf the government chairs, we'"". e got to finish this job or it will rain here. If  "" Couldn t you come, John?""  "" No, we · - can't get out of here."" ( They were squeezed in between floor and dirt.  "" Go find someone in the studi es building to help you.""  So off pattered Mrs. Rondy in the rain to the stu die s building and thaJ'e was Anita '  Fein.  "" Anita, the eJtlvermoont chairs m ve fallen off the parapet, get everyom in the  studies building to help put them back up."" And off rattered Mrso Rond. y do · "" rn the  stairway and the lower halls.

IN THE MEANTIME, Anita came to Bill Levi1s · study. There was Bill sitting on  the pillowed floor J a rti st 1 s bru sh in hand, painting the rear of a little church  in Taos, New Mexico, Yes, Bill was in New Mexico. His pipe angled out of his  mouth, veering slightly to the riEtlt, and smoked meditatively. He scarcely  heard Anita! s sweet voic e:  IIBill, Mrs. Rondy says to COITE help her get the government chairs. II  liThe government chairs? What ~ vernment chairs?"" ( Rernember, Bill is almost out of  the USA)  liThe govermrnent chairs have fallen off t1hl. e parapet. It  "" Where is the p3. rapet?""  "" I donft know. II  And sO ' Bill stays on there in Taos', but his thoughts are disturbed- where is the  parapet? He dreams of government chairs hurtling down from high walls as he  dabs the brush into the mud- brown p3. int for the side- wall of the Taos church.  ( Bill will be back with us on Wednesday, January 8).  6. New Year's Eve. There were two types of celebrat. ion _ on New Yearf sEve,  a party in the dining ffill early in the evening, and a quiet hour in the Quiet  HOllS e where the fire burned brig htly, later in t he evening.. Sorne went to bo th ;  others to'one; others' stayed in their own homes. ' Youngest member of the college  community, Ann Noland, DID stay up until michight, and KEPT her mamma and her  daddy up also -- nothing wrong, no crying; just joyfully conscious of a changing  year.  This has b~ en our vacation at BMC. The'government housing plumbers, electricians,  carpent ers, after a Chris tmas week off, are now hard at \', Qrk putting on the  final touches.

Entered as second­class matter November 4, 1942, at the Post Office at Black Mountain, North Carolina, under the Act of August 24, 1912.    Black Mounatin College  dedicates its second  Music Institute  to the memory of  Thomas Whitney Surette  a great teacher of music    The Second Music Institute of Black Mountain College,  Summer 1945, sponsored by the Music Department of the College, will be devoted to a study of polyphony and en­semble.    The music of the Nineteenth Century was increasingly domi­nated by the virtuoso and the mass orchestra. Seen as an ex­pression of its time, the worship of the virtuoso on the con­cert stage was a part of the hero worship of this age. The development of the mass orchestra coincided with the pro­cess of industrialization and mass production. Both develop­ments,  that of the virtuoso and that of the mass orchestra,  produced lasting masterworks. The amazing return of con­temporary music and contemporary musical practice to polyphony and to the smaller ensembles of chamber music may be understood as a reflection of the awareness of the fundamental task that confronts our generation: the re­conciliation between individual and society. Through bitter experiences the world has awakened to the realization that what we need is not heroes on the one hand and anonymous masses on the other, but that kind of society that permits the greatest possible development of each individual. Noth­ing  can teach us more about the relation of the one to the  many and the many to the one - even if in a symbolic  fashion only - than can vocal polyphony and instrumental ensemble. Here we have the ideal community of free indi­viduals, in which the whole makes possible the development of each part, while each part adapts itself to the higher order of the whole.    In drawing up the program and selecting the artists the  Music Department of Black Mountain College has striven  for closest possible co-ordination of theory and practice,  study and performance. The courses will concern themselves with the works performed. The works to be performed have been selected so as to be representative of great polyphony and chamber music through the ages. Works like Bach's Musical Offerings and his Art of the Fugue, and Haydn's Seven Words of the Saviour will be analyzed and discussed; they will be studied by the Collegium Musicum in open re­hearsals,  and finally performed in public.    The happy combination of artists experienced in the per­formance of old music and of scholars devoted to the inter­pretation and the revival of it promises an unusually inter­esting and fruitful music summer at Black Mountain College. The practical activities will be centered around the vocal and instrumental ensembles, the acapella chorus, the Col­legium Musicum, the chamber orchestra, and the string quartet.    The program will not be limited, however, to old or to poly­phonic music only. The decline and revival of polyphony since the days of the Viennese classical school will be illus­trated in courses and performances. The presence of out­standing singers and instrumentalists assures a generous consideration of solo music for voice and instruments.    The Institute hopes to make a contribution toward breaking down the artificial barriers between the musical scholar and the practicing musician, the theorist and the composer, the professional and the amateur, the music of the past and that of the present. The union of all these forces will be needed to create the music and the musical life of tomorrow.    Teachers and students will play together in the chamber orchestra and in the Collegium Musicum; they will discuss the complex problems of old and new styles of ensemble music. There will be also occasion for private tutorials.     Black Mountain College will be not merely the place where the Music Institute happens to be held. Rather, the Music Institute will be part of the life of the College; it will show visitors what Black Mountain College is doing and how.    One of the basic ideas of Black Mountain College is the  idea of community, which, in academic life, means intimacy between teacher and student, professional and amateur, the establishment of a genuinely personal relationship between workers in a common enterprise. The Music Institute will operate according to the pattern. It will be an opportunity for each to meet whom he chooses. Affairs will be settled less by rule than by mutual agreement. Since a number of regular Black Mountain College students will also be Insti­tute students, and since a considerable portion of the normal  College schedule will be in force, visitors will have the op­portunity to see for themselves the workings of this educa­tional experiment. Black Mountain College was dedicated to the discovery of new methods in education; students of the Institute can both observe the experiment and help to fur­ther it.    4    GUEST FACULTY    ERWIN BODKY Piano, harpsichord, clavichord.

GENERAL INFORMATION  Black Mountain College is situated in the heart of the  Great Craggy Mountains of Western North Carolina, a sec­tion noted for its climate and scenery. Because of the alti­tude - 2,400 feet - the summers are usually cool, particu­larly at night. The College campus with its farm and a little lake is just off U. S. Highway 70, three miles from the town of Black Mountain. The railroad station Black Mountain is on the scenic Southern Railroad Line from Salisbury to Asheville. Direct Pullman cars from New York to Black Mountain. The City of Asheville is fifteen miles from the College.    The lake is bordered on the south by the dining hall, with a dining porch; on the north, by the new studies building erected with student and faculty labor. The living quarters of the College students include two dormitory buildings with bedrooms for two, three and more persons.     Members of the Black Mountain College community take  care of their own rooms.    At Black Mountain College teachers and students live on  the campus. They have their meals together in the dining hall. Thus there is a constant personal contact among stu­dents and teachers.    The College farm supplies milk, meat, and vegetables to  the College kitchen.    The College community life in summer offers opportunities for dancing, picnics, light farm work, hiking, and swimming.    Clothing appropriate for walking in the mountains and for working outdoors should be provided, as well as ordinary city clothes suitable for this climate. Evening dresses are worn at dances and concerts.    9    Students are requested to bring with them their instruments and the solo music they wish to practice. It would be' help­ful if students who have chamber music scores would bring them also. The College will provide pianos and ensemble music.    Individual instruction outside the announced list of courses can be obtained by special arrangement. For particulars write to the Registrar, Black Mountain College, Black Moun­tain, North Carolina.    Black Mountain College will notify all applicants, if cir­cumstances should necessitate any important changes in the announced curriculum and faculty list of the Music  Institute.    Classes and lectures of the regular College summer session are open for registration to the members of the Music Institute in so far as they do not conflict in time with the curriculum of the Music Institute.    ADMISSION  A College committee admits applicants to the Music  Institute. The committee's decision is based upon the pre­vious training of applicants, their ability, and the part they can be expected to play in the Music Institute as well as in the College community.

For me it seems one of the most vital signs of what must and can be achieved for music in the United States, if we have the vision and courage and imagination which is demanded of us.  Roger Sessions (New York Times, September, 1944.)    This is a unique educational experiment, where the students and faculty are not only building their own buildings but really are attempting to demonstrate democratic procedure in an educational institution.  Eleanor Roosevelt ( My Day, April 10, 1941.)    Black Mountain is a living example of democracy in action. John Dewey.    I want to congratulate you upon the work you are doing.  You are here as a little community to work with your hands and your brains, which is a good thing for you. What is done out of pleasure is much better done than what is done out of duty. If you had to climb mountains out of duty, you could not mount these high mountains. I think that is also true with the high mountains of the spirit.  Albert Einstein.    Progressive education's most famous outpost.  Time Magazine, Dec. 27, 1943.    There should be at least one college such as this in every state, operated independently of the big universities, to provide custom- tailored education for those who want it and do the experimenting of which the big schools are almost incapable. P. M.    Nowhere on American college campuses IS there to be  found a more democratic spirit.  The Archive, Duke University, Durham, N. C.    I had thought to stay an hour or so, then go on. To shorten a long tale, instead of staying overnight, I remained for two and a half months. On the third day I found myself making notes about the place. And two weeks later I knew I had stumbled on what might eventually prove one of the most fascinating and probably important stories developing in  America today.

June 141  , J - lilt r · 7  I  •  Volume IV Number 4  II  As a liberal arts ' college Black Mountain College is neces­sarily  concerned with the essential problems of the times.  Today these problems are world- wide. They have grown  beyond the horizons of individual, group or nation. But  they must be understood by individuals and solved by  individuals. This generation will have acute need of both  vision and practical competence.  Issued five times a year, in February, March, April, May, and  November. Entered as second- class matter November 4, 1942,  at the Postoffice at Black Mountain, North Carolina, under the  Act of August 24, 1912.  Black Mountain College Bulletin  May, 1946.  To educate today, then, must mean to broaden outlook  and to provide a setting where theory can be confronted  with evidence, a laboratory where thought can be tested  by action. Black Mountain College as a community is such  a laboratory. The College, from its beginning, has recog­nized  and sought to develop the special functions that a  community can serve in general education. While carrying  on the traditional disciplines of college education, the  College seeks to combine the cultivation of imaginative  thought with training in accurate reasoning; it attempts  to develop foresight by emphasizing the search for funda­mental  principles that underlie transitory forms, and to  show that knowledge must be linked with a will to act.  It can reveal to what ends cooperation and competition  each lead, and bring into balance work directed toward  individual development and work done in the general in­terest  of a group.  EDUCATION IN THE MODERN WORLD  1  2  ORGANIZATION  The College is one of the few in the United States to he  owned by its faculty and entirely controlled by its teachers  and student body. The faculty has ultimate control of  College property and educational discipline. The College  has neither trustees nor the usual administrative officers,  such as president and deans. The faculty elects from its  membership a Board of Fellows which administers the  finances and makes faculty appointments. Student officers  attend faculty meetings dealing with the general affairs of  the College. The chief student officer, the moderator, is a  legal member of the Board of Fellows during his period  of office. As such he has full voting power and an equal  voice with the other eight members. Community problems  are brought to the general community meeting for dis­cussion  and, in so far as possible, for settlement. These  meetings, attended by all members of the staff, their fam­ilies  and the students, are in character much like the New  England town meeting.  SEMESTER SYSTEM  Beginning in September, 1946, the College changes from  its wartime accelerated program of four quarters per  year to a program of two semesters running approxi­mately  sixteen- and · a · hal£ weeks each. Registration will  take place September 18, 1946. Christmas vacation begins  at noon, December II, and ends at 8: 30 A. M., January 8,  1947. The First Semester closes February 8. Second Se­mester  begins February II. Spring Vacation starts at  noon, March 29, and closes at 8: 30 A. M., April 7. Second  Semester ends at noon, June 14.  COMMUNITY WORK PROGRAM  All members of the community devote some of their time  to practical work. This includes such work as planting,  tending and harvesting crops, and the clearing of forest  land for pasture. In addition, experience leading to the  acquirement of skills in building and construction is ob ·  tainable through activities in connection with necessary  maintenance and repair. Students help with office admin­istration,  assist in the dining hall, and work with the Col ·  lege Lihrarian. The College anticipates huilding soon, and  lumhering operations are now in progress to prepare a  supply of framing timher and flooring. Students con ·  tribute to and are responsible for many aspects of run ·  ning the community.  ADMISSION TO THE STpDENT BODY  The College has never had fixed regulations concerning  the age or scholastic background of applicants for ad­mission,  since it has preferred to consider each individual  case upon its merits. As a rule the prospective student  presents college preparatory credits, five references, and  a transcript of previous work. If grades are low, there  3  must be some compensatory evidence. The Admissions  Committee, which is composed of both faculty and stu­dents,  looks for seriousness of purpose in the applicant.  Experience shows that students who have arrived at a  desire for self · directed work, as well as for a certain  freedom of pace and sphere within which to study, are  the people who benefit most from Black Mountain  College. In the student body there are usually a number  with specific aims who have transferred from other col­leges.  In the case of such transfers it is often found that  Black Mountain College asks more of the student in terms  of self. discipline and capacity for sustained work than  his previous college experience did. Each applicant states  why he wants to come to Black Mountain and what he  expects to get from it. His desire to contribute to com­munity  life is always a consideration.  A faculty advisor is appointed for each entering student.  After the first semester the student may choose his own  advisor. Every student enters the Junior Division, which  roughly corresponds to Freshman and Sophomore years.  Upon recommendation of his advisor and approval of the  faculty, a student may take the comprehensive and de­tailed  examinations for admission to the Senior Division,  after which he selects his major but is expected to fill in  any gaps that remain in his general education.  GRADUATION  When a student has completed his plan of study, he asks  to be examined for graduation. If the Faculty find the  student's work satisfactory, they invite an outside ex­aminer  to the College. The examiner usually requires  seven three · hour papers covering the student's field of  study. These are followed by oral examinations. One of  the papers concerned with a special problem may be pre­sented  in thesis form. In the arts, exhibitions or perform.  ances may take the place of some of these papers. Grad ·  uation is decided upon by the Faculty. The decision is  based upon the report of the examiner and the student's  entire record.  The work demanded for graduation is equivalent to that  required for a Bachelor of Arts degree at colleges and  universities of long established standing. In the past, out­side  examiners have come from Duke University, Co ·  lumbia, Bryn Mawr, University of North Carolina, Prince ·  ton, St. John's College, Harvard, Yale, etc.  GENERAL INFORMATION  Black Mountain College is situated in the heart of the  Great Craggy Mountains of Western North Carolina, a  section noted for its climate and scenery. Because of the  altitude - 2,400 feet - the summers are usually cool,  particularly at night. The College campus with its farm  and a little lake is just off U. S. Highway 70, three miles  from the town of Black Mountain. The railroad station,  Black Mountain, is on the scenic Southern Railroad Line  from Salisbury to Asheville. Direct Pullman cars run from  4  New York to Black Mountain. The City of Asheville is  fifteen miles from the College.  The College lake is bordered on the south by the dining  hall, with a dining porch; on the north, by the new studies  building erected with student and faculty labor. The  living quarters of the College students include two dormi­tory  buildings with bedrooms for two, three and more  persons.  Members of the Black Mountain College community take  care of their own rooms.  At Black Mountain College teachers and students live on  the campus. They have their meals together in the dining  hall. Thus there is a constant personal contact among stu­dents  and teachers.  The College farm supplies milk, meat, and vegetables to  the College kitchen.  Clothing appropriate for walking in the mountains and  for working outuoors should be provided, as well as ordi­nary  city clothes suitable for this climate. Evening  dresses are worn at dances and concerts.  COURSES  The following courses were offered during all or part of  the 1915- 46 session and represent, in a somewhat limited  way, the area covered in a given year. The curriculum for  194647 will be expanded, since additions will be made to  the faculty. In many cases additional courses are given  when there is sufficient demand for them. Tutorials for  advanced students are given when need arises, and are  not listed below.

Bill should write for details.  $ 5.00  $ 25.00  $ 25.00  $ 10.00  the balance  $ 200.00  3/ 5 of balance  Application fee  Contingency deposit  Examination for graduation  Fee for late payment of any bill  The only other fees are:  Students who are unable to pay this fee are referred to  the section below on financial assistance. It is the specific  desire of the College that students otherwise qualified  should not be excluded for financial reasons.  The College cannot guarantee that a place will be reserved  for any student unless $ 200.00 has been deposited with  the College at the time the regular Financial Agreement  is signed. This Agreement, signed both by the student and  by the person responsible for payment of fees, completes  the admission and makes it effective. The deposit is not  refundable except at Faculty direction if the student with­draws  after this date, since a withdrawal from a reserved  place at the last moment may create a vacancy which  otherwise would have been filled. When students are ad­mitted  after this date the deposit must be made within  ten days of notification of acceptance and before arrival.  * An increase of 17 per cent over the year ' 45.' 46, to meet  increased costs.  The application fee must accompany application for ad­mission  to the College and is not refundable. Applicants  who are accepted by the College should make the con ·  tingency deposit of $ 25.00 within ten days of notification  of acceptance, since admission does not become effective  until this deposit is received. It is not refundable if the  new student fails to enter. While a student is in attend­ance  it must be maintained; but any unused portion of it  is refunded upon graduation or withdrawal. Bills are pay­able  on the date of the bill and if not paid within ten  days are subject to the fee for late payment.  On admission to complete financial  contract  On entrance, September 18, 1946  Opening day of second semester,  February n, 1947  Black Mountain College charges one inclusive fee for tui­tion,  room, board, use of laboratories, studies, music and  art lessons, lectures, concerts, and all except purely per­sonal  expenses. This fee is f'lyrteen hundred dollarA for  the regular academic year of two semesters. i It is payable  as follows:  11  OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION  12  .............  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  Believing that a cross- section of American life, economic­ally  as well as geographically, contributes to the educa­tional  value of the College, and realizing that ahility to  . ay the full fee is in no sense a criterion of the student's  desirability, the College tries to make financial assistance  available to qualified students who need it. Ideally, and in  so far as possible practically, admission to the student  body is made to depend upon personal merit. The Ad­missions  Committee decides upon each applicant, in the  first instance, quite independently of financial considera­tions.  Unfortunately, lack of endowment and limited re­sources  do not permit full expression of this principle,  since a certain gross income must be maintained from  student fees in order to meet the operating expenses of  the College, which approximate $ 1400 annually for each  student. Those who can are required to bear the full cost  of their education. Others pay as large a share of the full  fee as they can reasonably afford to, the deficie~ cy being  made up chiefly from gifts to the College.  In order to arrive at a fair figure, those who cannot afford  the full fee of $ 1400 are required to make an annual con­fidential  statement of their financial resources on a blank  furnished for the purpose by the College. On the basis of  this statement the Student Fees Committee' grants assist­ance  up to the amount of $ 900; that is to say, the (&gt; 1' 0­spective  student should not expect that his net fee would  be less than $ 500.  There is no provision for students' working their way  through the College. No distinction of any kind is made  between students on the basis of what they pay. All work  done by students is voluntary and without reference to  their financial status.  Each applicant, before his admission can become effective,  must submit a satisfactory Financial Agreement, signed  both by the student and by the person responsible for  payment of fees, and accompanied by the regular deposit  of $ 200.00. A new Agreement must be signed in advance  every year that the student remains in the College. The  College reserves the right to alter the fees from one year  to the next in the light of changed circumstances.  No student may enter or remain in residence while any  financial arrangements for the current year are pen"" ding.  For personal expenses students should have $ 20 to $ 30  per quarter exclusive of transportation.  There are available a few tuition scholarships whereby a  limited number of students who cannot pay the minimum  fee are enabled to attend the College for less.  SUMMER INSTITUTE  The Black Mountain Art Institute, under the directorship  of Josef Albers, will hold its third session during the sum­mer  of 1946, offering practising art courses and lectures  in various fields. Letters of inquiry have been pouring in  from prospective students all during the spring. Of the  College Art faculty, Anni Albers will conduct a class in  Textile Design. Joseph Albers will hold classes in Basic  Design and Color, and Mary Gregory plans a workshop  course in Woodwork. Jean Varda and Jacoh Lawrence, as  members of the guest faculty, will hold classes in paint­ing.  Concetta Scaravaglione and Leo Amino are to give a  course in sculpture. And Will Burtin, of Fortune, and  Leonard Lionni, of N. W. Ayer & Son, have arranged to  give a course in Advertising Art. Besides the courses there  will be regnlarly illustrated lectures on Architecture and  Planning by Walter Gropius, on Architecture and Art by  John McAndrew, on Painting by Balcomhe Greene, and  on Photography by Beaumont Newhall. Classes will be  open to art teachers and art students. The lectures will be  open to the general public. Various exhibitions will ac­company  lectures and classes in which modern teaching  methods will be stressed.  There will be no Summer Music Institute in 1946. Because  of the success of previous Art and Music Institutes there  are such large numbers of applications for each that it  will be impossible to accommodate both groups on ac­count  of limited housing facilities. Consequently, the plan  is to alternate, holding the Art Institute in 1946 and the  Music Institute during the summer of 1947. Students in­terested  in the Summer Music Institute of 1947 will be  considered according to the dates of their applications  and are advised to register as soon as convenient. When  the College building program makes sufficient space avail ·  able, there is every hope that the two institutes will again  be held simultaneously, with even more integration than  before.  13  BOARD OF FELLOWS  Josef Albers  Henry Bergman  David Corkran  Theodore Dreier  Mary Gregory  Fritz Hansgirg  Albert William Levi  Theodore Rondthaler  Erwin Straus  STUDENT OFFICERS  Henry Bergman, Moderator  Judith Chernoff  Lucy Swift  James Tite  ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF  Rector  Chairman of the Board  of Fellows  Chairman of the Faculty  Treasurer  Secretary  Registrar  Assistant Registrar  Librarian  Plant and Maintenance  14  Theodore Dreier  Josef Albers  Herbert A.

Historically the  underlying purpose of education has always been to equip  the student with the knowledge, attitudes, and habits of  thinking and doing which prepare him for active par.  ticipation in the life of his contemporary period. As  the main currents of thought change from period to  period, so do educational principles. Now that the indi­vidual  is coming, regardless of background, to be con­sidered  worthy of respect, possessing human dignity, and  entitled to a voice in his own destiny, his effective par­ticipation  in life requires a different sort of educational  preparation than did that of his forbears.  Today's confusion, wherein old certainties, crumbling  away, have not yet been replaced by new ones, confronts  the individual with the necessity of re- solving many pri.  vate and social problems concerning his place and function  in relation to the world. Of him is now required the  ability to act and the judgment to act wisely. The task  of education, therefore, becomes that of preparing young  people by developing as highly as possible their latent ca­pacities  for intelligent, self- reliant responsibility.  Successful education cannot be expected unless teachers  are masters of what they teach, recognize the relation of  what they teach to the society in which they teach, and  have a sympathetic understanding of those whom they  teach. Nor can it be expected if students lack a desire to  6  learn sufficiently strong to overcome the lure of trivial  distractions, or on the other hand if they are so devoted  to a specific interest that they ignore other spheres of life.  Freedoms carry their own limitations, and to accept the  duty imposed by the freedom demands much of the  individual.  In an endeavor to implement these principles, Black  Mountain College was founded in 1933 by a group of  teachers and students as a college of liberal arts which  should be c. oeducational, where ultimate control should  rest with the Faculty, where established methods of edu­cation  could combine with newer, experimental methods,  and where faculty and students should share responsi­bility  in the process of learning and in the accompanying  process of living decently, productively, wisely, in a  relatively small community.  ORGANIZATION  The charter of the College places ownership of its  properties and control of its affairs with the Faculty. The  Faculty is directly responsible for educational policy and  discipline. From its membership it elects a Board of  Fellows empowered to make appointments and administer  finances. The Faculty elects the & ector from the Board  to preside over that body; and the Board elects a Secre­tary  and a Treasurer. Thus there is no sharp cleavage  between the administrative and the educational functions  of the College.  In the belief that to become responsible requires under­taking  responsibility, the Faculty provides that a large  share in the running of the College shall fall to students.  The chief student officer, the moderator, elected by stu­dents  from among themselves, is a legal, voting member  of the Board of Fellows. He and other student officers  meet from time to time with the Board or the Faculty.  Students serve on committees, including the Admissions  Committee, ' largely govern their own affairs, and take  eharge of many aspects of college and community life.  Occasionally questions affecting the social unit as a whole  are discussed at general meetings where everyone- stu­dents,  faculty, personnel, and other members of the com­munity-  has a voice.  The lllain function of the Black Mountain College com­munity  is to provide a fruitful environment for education  in academic, creative, practical, and social pursuits. Since  the ideal of democracy is not its form but the enjoyment  of it, set organization of daily life is held to a minimum.  Policies and procedures are generally arrived at by agree­ment  rather than by rule. Life at Black Mountain may  be , said to fall into several overlapping and interrelated  areas: the curriculum, including class and individual  study; community COllcerns, including welfare regulations  and work programs;. recreation, including concerts, exhibi­tions,  , movies, and oth. er: entertainment.  CURRICULUM AND' STUDY ·  . It is. growing increasingly clear that the age of isolated  specialization is over. The: advanced scientist now perceives  that to augment his knowledge of science he must under­stand  the general principles of fields heretofore regarded  as unrelated to science. The same is true of music and  the arts, of the philosopher and the economist, the his ·  torian and the writer. At the middle of the 20th century,  the emphasis- in painting as well as in political theory­is  on what happens between things, not on the things in  themselves. Today the area of exploration, the premise  underlying systematic thinking, is that of function, process,  change; of interaction and communication. The universe  - including man and his interests- is seen, in microcosm  and in macrocosm, as the continuously changing result of  the influence that each of its parts exerts upon all the rest  of its parts.  This does not mean that factual knowledge of a given  subject is of negligible value. On the contrary, to under­stand  a process between two things carries an obligation  to know a good deal about the two things. But knowledge,  to be useful to an intelligently responsible man or woman,  cannot consist solely of an additive accumulation of unre­lated  data or collection of memorized formulae. To be­come  effective each acquired datum or formula acts on  and is acted upon by all those previously acquired, and  through this interaction the concepts erected from the  integration of previously effective knowledge are slightly  altered.  The process of learning Yaries greatly among individuals  depending on their educational background, native ability,  and seriousness of intent. It has been the experience of  Black Mountain College in its sixteen years of existence  that, roughly speaking, entering students fall into two  general categories: those who are somewhat mature,  reasonably sure of their major interests, and in possession  of the ability to study; and those who do not yet know in  what field they wish to specialize, what they want to do  after leaving college, or how to go about their work. The  college curriculum, the · refore, is flexible so that students  may elect those studies which they believe will best meet  their needs. There are no required courses, and courses  vary from semester to semester according to current de­mand.  Since faculty members are free to teach what they  wish in the manner they prefer, classes are conducted in  several ways- as lectures, recitations, seminars, tutorials.  Along with the advanced work, both guided and self.  directed, suitable to students of some training and ma­turity,  the curriculum provides for the needs of younger  people lacking the knowledge of how to study. Here the  purpose of the College is to evoke in the student those  hahits of work which enable him to acquire knowledge in  any field. Once thus equipped, he gains an ability for  independent work which prepares him to deal with life  1  8  under almost any . circumstances. In this aspect of teaching  the emphasis lies on "" how"" rather than on "" what,"" on  method rather than on suhject, on process rather than  on ohject.  How t() work can he learned regardless of what subject  furnishes the material to work on, but the learning process  is greatly facilitated by interest in the subject. Since  Black Mountai'n College offers courses in four main fields  - the arts, language and literature, science, and the social  , sciences- students JI!. ay approach the acquisition of method  by the avenue of their preference.  A faculty advisor is appointed for each entering student.  The student may choose his own advisor after his first  semester. The ratio of teachers to students is one to five  or six so that the student receives a considerable degree  of personal attention. Except when a student is sure of  what he wants to do, the first part of his stay is regarded  as a period of investigation; all students who have not  previously done so are encouraged to take courses in art,  language and literature, science, and the social studies in  order that they may discover their major interest through  selecting from the known, or that they may gain some  understanding of fields other than their own.  Since education at Black Mountain takes place in the  setting of a community and is conceived as a balance  between the intellectual, creative, and social arts, the  academic curriculum is supplemented by practical ex­perience  in craftsmanship, physical work, and group re­sponsibilities.  In workshops such as bookbinding, print­ing,  weaving, woodworking, students may acquire the rudi ·  ments of the manual skills demanded by a craft, as well  as an acquaintance with its principles and methods.  Pleasure in concrete doing is often as great as pleasure in  abstract thinking.  Replacing the usual organization of sports and physical  , education, the College provides a program of work in  eonnection with maintaining its physical existence. Al­though'  it is not required, all members of the community  able to do so are expected to share in the work of running  the community: upkeep of buildings and grounds, oc­easional  design and erection of new buildings, wood ·  eutting and road repair; library and administrative work;  office, kitchen, housekeeping routines. Actual experience  gives a certain manual dexterity and a familiarity with  handling tools and with such mechanical techniques as  plumbing, carpentry, wiring, fire- fighting, clerical work.  A farm of about 30 acres, ~ wned by the College but  , , operated as an independent unit, provides practical ex­perience  in a basic, productive enterprise. Its role is  threefold: to furnish milk, meat, vegetables, and eggs to  the college kitchen, to improve soil fertility, and to serve  , as a laboratory for academic subjects bearing on agri­culture  and its relationship to society.  9  Through' the work program the student derives not only  healthy exercise but a sense of the details arising from  living in- a group. He learns to collaborate with otherfl  and to undertake with _ them enterprises for the common  good. A fundamental human problem is the search for the  point of balance between the needs, rights, and responsi­bilities  of the individual and the needs, rights, responsi­bilities  of the group. The College feels it will have ac­complished  its purpose if students depart with specific  knowledge in their field, techniques of work transferable  to other fields, integrity and self- respect coupled with re­spect  for others, and the ability to participate actively and  with discrimination in the life of society.  FIELDS OF STUDY  Work in the arts depends upon the eye and the hand. In  music it depends on the ear and the hand. Any branch of  art carries with it a severe discipline different from but  as rigorous as that inherent in physics or mathematics.  But the disciplines in art are not necessarily measurable in  terms of language. Truth depicted in graphic line, in  solid mass, in sound, is none the less valid for ahsence of  verbal expreSSIon, and its effect upon the human heing  is an extremely important part of his experience.  The specialized training yielded by language and litera­ture  goes further than the ohvious advantages of reading  and speaking a foreign language; it reveals the hahits of  thought and the structure of a language different from  that native to us. In this era of universality the individual  conversant with only one language and its concomitant  thinking processes is limited in his understanding not only  of the heritage of literature hut of current thought.  Upon the sciences- physics, chemistry, mathematics in  particular- today's thought places the hurden of leader­ship.  As in the past, what scientists learn affects philoso­phy,  ethics, religion, art, technology, economics, sociology.  Scientists discover that atomic energy can be controlled;  for what purposes it shall be controlled depends upon the  will and desire of human beings at large.  No one who has not studied what groups of people have  done in the past can sensibly arrive at an opinion as to  what society can do and should aim at. The social sciences  embrace such realms as the recorded history of events,  the customs and habits of social units, the relation of social  units to each other, the integration of the individual and  the group, methods of transferring goods from producer  to consumer, the earth's capacity to produce in relation to  the needs of the earth's population.  Black Mountain College, realizing that knowledge tran­scends  subject, that each field carries its own techniques,  that theoretical training is inadequate without practical  . experience, and intellectual education is inadequate with-  10  out social adjustment, has directed its teaching methods,  its courses, and its daily life to this complex and manifold  end. There is provision for the individual needs of each  student who enters.  PLAN OF STUDY  Although there are no required courses and no required  number of credit hours, the beginning student without  conviction as to his ultimate goal is expected to undertake  a diversified, general program. The courses he elects are  intended to increase his knowledge in more than one field,  and to clarify the direction of his interest. The entering  student who knows the direction of his interest and has  already investigated the other main fields may concentrate  upon the field of his interest. In either case when it is evi­dent  that the student is ready to specialize, he prepares  a plan of study in his field with the collaboration of his  advisor. Permission to prepare for graduation depends  upon faculty approval of this plan, and upon written and  oral examinations in the fields in which he has studied.  The student is also expected to have learned to work by  himself and assume responsibility in the commun~ ty.  A comprehensive examination is made available each year  to those students who wish to find out how they stand  ~ n general knowledge and maturity, as evaluated by the  Faculty. The progress of each student is periodically dis­cussed  by the Faculty as a whole. Although records are  kept for reference and for possible transfer of credit, no  academic grades are given to students.  GRADUATION  When a student has completed his plan of study he asks  to be examined for graduation. If the Faculty finds his  work satisfactory, an outside examiner is invited to the  College. For the student intending to continue his studies  and knowing which graduate school he desires to enter,  the College attempts to obtain an outside examiner from  that school. Otherwise the College invites the best avail.  able examiner in the field of the student's major interest.  The examiner usually requires papers covering the stu­dent's  field of study. These are followed by oral exami.  nation. Exhibitions or performances may supplement the  papers. Graduation is decided upon by the Faculty, which  bases its decision on the report of the examiner and on the  student's entire record at the College.  The work demanded for graduation is equivalent to that  required for a Bachelor of Arts degree at colleges and  universities of long- established standing. Black Mountain  College confers a Certificate of Graduation. Its students  have done commendable work in leading graduate schools.  11  GENER~ LINFORMATION  Black Mountain College, at an elevation of 2,400 feet, is  situated in the Great Craggy Mountains of Western North  Carolina, a section noted for its climate and scenery. The  College is just off US 7@, some five miles from the town of  Black Mountain, and about fifteen miles east of Asheville.  Direct pullman service connects Black Mountain with New  York and Chicago via the Southern Railway, and the Delta  Airlines has an airport in Asheville.  The property of the College comprises approximately 700  acres of farm and mountain woodland, and a small lake.  There are 30 buildings- student dormitories, cottages for  faculty families or married students, dining hall, library,  workshops, two small music buildings, a farmhouse and  barns. Classrooms and individual studies for faculty and  students are provided by the Studies Building, designed  by A. Lawrence Kocher and erected by students and fac­ulty  members.  At Black Mountain College personal contact between  students and teachers is constant. Students and faculty live  on the campus, have their meals together in the dining  hall, and work together on maintenance and various  aspects of daily living as well as in the classroom.  Members of the community take care of their own rooms.  Clothing should be appropriate for walking in the moun­tains  and working outdoors. Ordinary clothes should be  suitable for country living in warm and cold weather.  Since old clothes or work clothes are worn during the day,  an extensive wardrobe is not necessary. Evening dresses  are worn occasionally at parties or concerts.  The kitchen cannot furnish special diets.  No pets may be brought without special permission. Fire­arms,  if brought, must be kept in the office. Students may  have cars, but there are no garage facilities.  "",  ADMISSION TO THE STUDENT BODY  The College, which limits the number of the student body  to 90, has no fixed regulations concerning the age or  scholastic background of applicants for admission, since  it prefers to consider each individual upon the merits of  his case. As a rule, the prospective student presents college  preparatory credits, a transcript of previous work, five  references, and health and oculist certificates. If grades  are low, there must be some evidence of compensatory  qualifications. The Admissions Committee looks, among  other things, for seriousness of purpose in the applicant.  This is difficult to judge in advance, and the ability to  work with others needs to be tried out. Applicants who  are admitted are, therefore, invited to participate in col­lege  and community life for a year, subject to review at  the end of each term. At the end of each year those who  have shown sufficient capacity for working on their own  responsibility in the areas of their own interests and in  those of the group are invited to return for further study,  with the possibility of graduation.  FEES  Black Mountain College charges a fee of $ 1600,* which  covers tuition and room and boat: d for the regular academic  year of two semesters. There are no other fees except the  occasional items listed below. The schedule of payment is  as follows:  On notification of acceptance, to reserve  a place ( non- refundable)  On opening day of fall semester  On opening day of spring semester  $ 200  800**  600  Students unable to pay this fee are referred to the section  below on financial assistance. It is the specific desire of  the College that students otherwise qualified should not  be excluded for financial reasons.  The fee of $ 1600 is intended to cover all of a student's  expenses except those that are purely personal, and the  following items:  Application fee  Contingency deposit  Exam'ination for graduation  Fee for late payment of any hill  $ 5  25  35  10  12  * The College reserves the right to change this fee if costs  increase.  ** Plus contingency deposit of $ 25.  13  PROCEDURE  The College writes a Financial Agreement with each  student each year, setting forth the terms of attendance.  The Agreement is signed by the student and by the person  responsible for payment of fees. It is validated by the  prepayJrient of $ 200. No place is reserved for any student  until the signed Agreement and the prepayment are re­ceived.  The prepayment is not refundable. It is a pay­ment  in advance on the student's fee, and is so credited.  The Agreement and prepayment complete the admission  and make it effective.  The contingency deposit, due on opening day, must be ·  maintained while the student is in attendance; breakage,  damage or loss are charged against it, but any unused por­tion  is refunded after graduation or withdrawal. Fees  are payable on schedule and_ if not paid within ten days  are subject to the fee for late payment. The application  fee must accompany any application for admission, and is  not refundable.  . The inclusive fee for the eight- week Summer Session  of 1949 is $ 380, subject in general to the same sort of  financial terms as the Jee for the other semesters. Detailed  information will be sent on request.  Veterans planning to attend under the provisions of the GI  Bill should write for details. .  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  Believing that a cross- section of American life, eco­nomically  as well as geographically, contributes to the  educational v; ilue of the College, and realizing that ability  to pay the full fee is not a criterion of desirability, the  College tries to make financial assistance available to  qualified students who need it. In so far as practically  possible, admission is made to depend upon personal merit.  Those who can are required to pay the full fee. Others  pay as large a share of the full fee as they can reasonably  afford.  In order to arrive at a fair figure, those who cannot afford  the full fee of $ 1600 are required to make an annual  confidential statement of their financial resources on a  blank furnished for the purpose by the College. On the  basis of this statement the Committee on Student Fees  grants reductions up to a maximum amount of $ 600; that  is to say, under no circumstances should the prospective  student expect that his net fee will be less than $ 1000.  There is no provision for students' working their way  through College. No distinction of any kind is made  between students on the basis of what they pay. Their  participation in the work program is without regard to  their financial status.  The Derek Bovingdon Memorial Loan Fund makes possible  occasional small loans to students who need money to  complete work already begun at the College. The fund is  not intended for loans' to entering students.  OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION  14  No student may enter or remain in residence while  financial arrangements- for. the current year are pending.  A new Financial Agreement must be signed in advance  each year the student remains in the College, and must be  supported by tbe regUlar non- refundable prepayment. The  College reserves the right io - alter individual fees from  year to year in the . light of changed circumstances.  Physicians' services and special medicines must be paid for  individually. :  For personal expenses students should have $ 50 to $ 90  each semester exdusive of transportation.  The College is not tesponslble for loss, theft, or damage  to students' property arising from any cause.  SUMMER SESSION  In addition to the fall and spring semesters of the regular  academic year, the College conducts a summer session in  July and August of about eight weeks. Its regular winter  faculty is augmented by a Guest Faculty of men and  women highly distingUished in their fields who are other­wise  engaged during the winter. Along with academic  courses, the curriculum provides for workshop groups,  discussion groups, and individual work, as well as special  projects such as, in 1949, the plan to build a new Science  Laboratory.  The summer session offers an excellent opportunity for a  short period of intensive work and experimentation in  stimulating, congenial surroundings. It also affords an  opportunity to observe the process of education in the  . setting of a community. As a rule, some of its summer  students apply for admission into the following terms of  the regular academic year.  /",State Archives of North Carolina,"Yandle, Ashley",,,Text;,,,,2013-10-03,2013-10-03,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll44/id/607,608.cpd,Volume6/BMCRP_BMCBulletinNewsletterVII-No1_BMCBulletin1949-50-1.pdf,/p249901coll44/supp/607/index.pdf

Black Mountain College Bulletin V()! ume V Number 3  April 1947  To educate today, then, must mean to broaden outlook  and to provide a setting where theory can be confronted  with evidence, a laboratory where thought can be tested  by action. Black Mountain College as a community is such  a laboratory. The College, from its beginning, has recog­nized  and sought to develop the special functions that a  community can serve in general education. While carrying  on the traditional disciplines of college education, the  College seeks to combine. the cultivation of imaginative  thought with training in accurate reasoning; it attempts  to develop foresight by emphasizing the search for funda­mental  principles that underlie transitory forms, and to  show that knowledge must be linked with a will to act.  It can reveal to what ends cooperation and competition  each lead, and · bring into balance work directed toward  inJividual development and work done in the general in­terest  of a group.  As a liberal arts college Black Mountain College is neces­sarily  concerned with the essential problems of the times.  Today these problems are world- wide. They have grown  beyond the horizons of individual, group or nation. But  they must be understood by individuals and solved by  individuals. This generation will have acute need of both  vision and practical competence.  1  2  ORGANIZATION  The College is one of the few in the United States to be  owned by its faculty and entirely controlled by its teachers  and the student body. The faculty has ultimate control  of College property and educational discipline. The Col­lege  has neither trustees nor the usual administrative  officers, such as president and deans. The faculty elects  from its membership a Board of Fellows which ad­ministers  the finances and makes faculty appointments.  Student officers attend faculty meetings dealing with the  general affairs of the College. The chief student officer,  the moderator, is a legal member of the Board of Fellows  during his period of office. As such he has full voting  power and an equal voice with the other eight members.  Community problems are occasionally brought to the  general community meetings for discussion, and in so far  as possible, for settlement. The meetings, attended by all  members of the staff, their families and the students, are  in character much like the New England town meeting.  Questions that come up in connection with the daily life  of the total community are referred to a Community  Council, representing faculty, staff, students, and all  other members of the community.  YEAR ROUND PROGRAM  The year at Black Mountain College is divided into speci­fied  academic tenns and into free periods at Christmas,  Easter, and the beginning and end of summer. Continuity  in the life of the community is maintained year round in  work on the fann, general maintenance, and administra­tion.  This means that a portion of the community ar­ranges  to remain during vacations to keep the plant go­ing,  also regarding these periods as valuable opportuni­ties  for independent work and study.  The first semester will begin at 8: 30 a. m., September 17,  1947. Christmas free period will extend from noon De­cember  13, 1947, to 8: 30 a. m., January 7, 1948. The first  semester will end February 4, 1948. The second semester  will begin 8: 30 a. m., February 12, 1948. The spring free  period will extend from March 27 to April 5, 1948. The  second semester will end June 16, 1948. Summer session  dates to be announced.  COMMUNITY WORK PROGRAM  All members of the community devote some of their time  to practical work. This includes the routine tasks of  maintenance plus such work as planting, tending and  harvesting crops, and the clearing of forest land for  pasture. Some experience leading to the acquirement of  skills in building and construction is obtainable through  activities in connection with necessary maintenance and  repair. The College anticipates building soon; and  lumbering, surveying, and building of models have been  engaged in. Students contribute to and are responsible  for many aspects of running the community.  3  ADMISSION TO THE STUDENT BODY  The College has never had fixed regulations concerning  the age or scholastic background of applicants for admis­sion,  since it has preferred to consider each individual  case upon its merits. As a rule the prospective student  presents college preparatory credits, five references, and  a transcript of previous work. If grades are low, there  must be some compensatory evidence. The Admissions  Committee, which is composed of both faculty and  students, looks for seriousness of purpose in the applicant.  Experience shows that. students who have arrived at a  desire for self- directed work, as well as for a certain  freedom of pace and sphere within which to study, are  the people who benefit most from Black Mountain College.  In the student body there are usually a number with  . specific aims who have transferred from other colleges.  In the case of such transfers it is often found that Black  Mountain College asks more of the student in terms of  self- discipline and capacity for sustained work than his  previous college experience did. Each applicant states  why he wants to come to Black Mountain and what he  expects to get from it. His desire to contribute to com­munity  life is always a consideration.  A faculty advisor is appointed for each entering student.  After the first semester the student may choose his own  advisor. A comprehensive examination is made available  each year to those students who wish to find out how they  stand in general knowledge and maturity, as evaluated by  the' faculty. At the time the student presents his plan of  work toward graduation, he is given a detailed examination  of his total preparation for the undertaking. Admission  to candidacy for graduation is granted upon approval of  the graduation plan if the student meets high standards  of competence in academic work, initiative and respon­sibility  in community work, and sensitivity in the arts.  GRADUATION  When a student has completed his plan of study, he asks  to be examined for graduation. If the Faculty find the  student's work satisfactory, they invite an outside ex­aminer  to the College. The examiner usually requires  seven three- hour papers covering the student's field of  study. These are followed by oral examinations. One of  the papers concerned with a special problem may be pre­sented  in thesis form. In the arts, exhibitions or perform­ances  may take the place of some of these papers. Grad­uation  is decided upon by the Faculty. The decision is  based upon the report of the examiner and the student's  entire record.  Black Mountain College confers no degree. The work de­manded  for graduation is equivalent to that required for  a Bachelor of Arts degree at colleges and universities of  long established standing. In the past, outside examiners  have come from Duke University, Columbia, Bryn Mawr,  University of North Carolina, Princeton, St. John's Col-  4  lege, Harvard, Yale, Antioch, University of Wisconsin,  and other institutions.  GENERAL INFORMATION  Black Mountain College is situated in the heart of the  Great Craggy Mountains of Western North Carolina, a  section noted for its climate and scenery. Because of the  altitude - 2,400 feet - the summers are usually cool,  particularly at night. The College campus with its farm  and a little lake is just off U. S. Highway 70, three miles  from the town of Black Mountain. The railroad station,  Black Mountain, is on the scenic Southern Railroad Line  from Salisbury to Asheville. Direct Pullman cars run from  New York to Black Mountain. The City of Asheville is  fifteen miles from the College.  The college lake is bordered on the south by the dining  hall, with a dining porch; on the north, by the Studies  Building erected with student and faculty labor. The  living quarters of the college students include two dormi­tory  buildings with bedrooms for two, three and more  persons, and four temporary housing units supplied reo  cently by the government.  Members of the Black Mountain College community take  care of their own rooms.  At Black Mountain College teachers and students live on  the campus. They have their meals together in the dining  hall. Thus there is a constant personal contact of students  and teachers.  The college farm supplies milk, meat, and vegetables to  the college kitchen.  Clothing appropriate for walking in the mountains and  for working outdoors should be provided, as well as  ordinary city clothes suitable for this climate. Evening  dresses are worn at dances and concerts.  FIELDS OF STUDY  Each year study is conducted in the four broad fields of  the Arts, Language and Literature, Mathematics and  Science, and Social Studies. Specific courses vary from  year to year according to faculty in residence, student  demands, and needs. These courses are supplemented by  tutorials and informal study groups, which handle materi ·  al not included in the formal schedule. Training toward  independent and self · directed work is an aim of Black  Mountain College. Students are advised to make a  schedule that will give them time to do outside work on  their own. They are also advised, at least in a long range  way, to balance their programs between reading, making,  and doing.  The following courses were given during 1946 · 1947. They  represent, within limits, the area covered during a year.  Courses for 1947- 1948 will be announced shortly before  5  the heginning of the fall term. Students interested in  taking certain courses at a certain time should inquire  whether such courses are to he given.  In the Arts, work was conducted in Painting, Drawing,  Woodworking, Voice, Piano, Ensemhle, Introduction to  Music, Harmony, Counterpoint, Prohlems of Musical  Form and Structure from Gregorian Chant to Bach,  A Capella, Chorus, Bookhinding, Weaving, Writing.  Spontaneous groups of interested students and faculty  studied Art History, and conducted play readings.  In Languages, French and German were cultivated  through contact with foreign- hred faculty and students;  elementary Latin was provided in the curriculum.  Courses in Literature included American Literature  hefore 1860, Shakespeare, Literary Criticism, Thomas  Mann, Modem Prose Fiction.  Mathematics and Science stressed hoth theoretical and  lahoratory considerations: Mechanics and Mathemati­cal  Analysis, Mathematics, Physics of Maintenance  Work, Statics, Introduction to Theoretical Chemistry.  Courses in Social Studies were given in psychology,  sociology, economics, history, philosophy: Human Re­lations,  Psychology of Social Issues, Dynamics of  Learning, Cultural History of the Greek Wodd, Cultur­al  History of the Medieval Wodd, Race Prohlems, Com­parative  Religion, World Today, Historical Introduc­tion  to Present- Day Economic Analysis, International  Economics, Introduction to American Lahor, Seminar  in Economics, American Civilization, Foreign Policy  of the United States since 1900, Philosophy of Plato  and Aristotle, Prohlems of Philosophy, History of Ex­traordinary  Communities.  Study of Farming, hoth theoretical and practIcal, was  conducted under the supervision of the two college  farmers.  Shorthand and typewrItmg were taught informally at  the college office.  The faculty at Black Mountain College teach what they  wish, considering need as well as preference; therefore  curriculum can be only approximately predicted. Study is  not wholly a matter of participation in the courses sche­duled  for any given term. There is the opportunity to  engage in work of a widely various kind, depending upon  the initiative of the student and the facilities availahle.  Also it is a part of the life here for people who are inter­ested  to get together, and, for example, to read plays or  to conduct additional experiments in psychology, or to  dance, or to experiment with printing at the college print  shop, or to do research in Commuity. These things are  6  not provided in advance; when they happen it is because  the individuals who are here create them.  Classes are conducted in a variety of ways at Black Moun­tain  College: by laboratory practice, by lecture, by dis­cussion,  by seminar, by tutorial, by connection with the  operation of the place itself. Instructors differ widely in  approach and personality. But it seems to be true that  though materials and methods differ, there is a kind of  common gain from the close and loving pursuit of dif­ferent  subjects. So the quality of study, rather than the  number of COUNes, measures the development of taste,  judgment, workmanlike habits of thinking and producing,  dexterity, thoroughness, imagination, confidence.

The Con­tingency  Deposit is due on entrance, and must be main­tained  while a student is in attendance; but any unused  portion of it is refunded upon graduation or withdrawal.  Bills are payable on the date of the bill and if not paid  within ten days are subject to the fee for late payment.  The Community Council assessment, expended at the dis­cretion  of the Community Council in the general com­munity  interest, varies with needs, but in no case exceeds  $ 10.00.  As stated above, the inclusive fee of $ 1600 is intended  to cover all of a student's expenses except those that are  purely personal, and the following occasional items:  Students who are unable to pay this fee are referred to  the section below on financial assistance. It is the specific  desire of the College that students otherwise qualified  should not be excluded for financial reasons.'  The College cannot guarantee that a place will be re­served  for any student unless $ 200.00 has been deposited  with the College at the time the regular Financial Agree­ment  is signed. This Agreement, signed both by the stu­dent  and by the person responsible for payment of fees,  completes the admission and makes it effective. The de­posit  is not refundable except at Faculty direction if the  student withdraws later.  Black Mountain College charges one inclusive fee for  tuition, room, meals, use of laboratories, studies, music  and art lessons, lectures and concerts. This fee is $ 1600  for the regular academic year of two semesters.* It is in­tended  to cover all of a student'os expenses except those  that are purely personal, and certain occasional items  lis1: ed below. It is payable as follows:  12  13  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  Believing that a cross- section of American life, economic­ally  as well as geographically, contributes to the educa­tional  value of the College, and realizing that ability to  pay the full fee is in no sense a criterion of the student's  desirability, the College tries to make financial assistance  available to qualified students who need it. Ideally, and in  so far as possible practically, admission to the student  body is made to depend upon personal merit. The Ad­missions  Committee decides upon each applicant, in the  first instance, quite independently of financial considera­tions.  Unfortunately, lack of endowment and limited re­sources  do not permit full expression of this principle,  since a certain gross income must be maintained from  student fees in order to meet the operating expenses of  the College. Those who can are required to pay full fee.  Others pay as large a share of the full fee as they can  reasonably afford to, the deficiency being made up chiefly  from gifts to the College.  In order to arrive at a fair figure, those who cannot afford  the full fee of $ 1600 are required to make an annual con­fidential  statement of their financial resources on a blank  furnished for the purpose by the College. On the basis of  this statement the Student Fees Committee grants assist­ance  up to a maximum amount of $ HOO; that is to say,  under no circumstances should the prospective student  expect that his net fee will be less than $ 500.  There is no provision for students' working their way  through College. No distinction of any kind is made be­tween  students on the basis of what they pay. All work  done by students is voluntary and without reference to  their financial status.  OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION  Each applicant, before his admission can become effective,  must submit a satisfactory Financial Agreement, signed  both by the student and by the person responsible for  payment of fees, and accompanied by the regular deposit  of $ 200.00. A new Agreement must be signed in advance  each year that the student remains in the College. The  College reserves the right to alter the fees from one year  to the next in the light of changed circumstances.  No student may enter or remain in residence while any  financial arrangements for the current year are pending.  For personal expenses students should have $ 30 to $ 45 per  semester exclusive of transportation.  There are available a few tuition scholarships whereby a  limited number of students who cannot pay the minimum  fee are enabled to attend the College for less.  The College is not responsible for loss, theft, or damage  to students' property arising from any cause.  14  STUDENTS 1946- 1947  Adams, Henry B.  Adamy, Edward N.  Albright, Neil K.

Assemblyand Dining Hall and twin dormitories at left.    Black Mountain College is a small cosmopolitan community of students and teachers living to­gether  an education stressing democratic co-operation. Through participation in the life of the community, through study and discussion of the past and present, through the discipline of the studio, the laboratory, and a comprehensive campus work-experience program, it is preparing citizens with the understanding and the maturity to playa constructive part in the world at war and in the post-war world.    Black Mountain differs in many respects from traditional liberal education. It rejects the re­quired curriculum, the report card, the board of trustees. It finds that intensive and independent work under faculty guidance, discussion classes, continual contact with teachers, are more conducivc to learning than the syllabus and the weekly quiz. It finds that participation in the operation  and maintenance of the College and its community are better guides to a democratic way of life than fraternity politics or organized athletics. It finds that eager students living, studying, work­ing with interesting people in a stimulating community, discover themselves and the world as they never could through the academic formality of a more traditional college.    This booklet is intended to show you something of the way in which Black Mountain people live  and work; what they believe in, and what they do.    College means study and study at Black Mountain means hard work. It means extensive reading and considerable reflection. It means the experience of creating and the adventure of dis­covery. It means hours in a study behind a ""do not disturb"" sign, and it means discussions and conversations from break­fast  to bedtime. It means that a student works intensively in a chosen field, but it means also that he takes courses in the social sciences, the physical sciences, the arts, language and literature. Above all, it means finding things out for himself, coming to his own conclusions about them, fitting past and present ideas and events into his conception of the world.    Academic life at Black Mountain takes the form of private reading, small classes and individual tutorials. Intimacy be­tween students and teachers has particularly happy results in the study of languages. For not only can students become fa­miliar with foreign culture through foreign literature; they can also learn to speak any of the chief western languages  through conversation. The shared experiences of community life vivify the study of the social sciences, philosophy, psy­chology, and literature, which is considered as an expression of the inner life of mankind. Through discussion and reading  the motives, desire and experiences of men are seen in uni­versal perspective. Serious writing is encouraged. Students write and produce plays, and each year are responsible for a series of radio broadcasts which originate from class materials.    In social science the fundamentals of social analysis are studied both as theory and in their application to the history of civili­zation. The more recent past is examined with emphasis on both America and international relations. Student and teachers reflect different currents of political thought, and while a scholarly approach is insisted upon, controversy is en­couraged. For the social scientist today is not merely an in-quirer, he has to take a stand against fascism in the war and beyond.    Graduation is based upon achievement rather than on credit hours or length of residence. Rigorous comprehensive exami­nations are personally given by an authority from outside the College when a student is fully prepared. The examiners are from the country's leading universities.    To discover and to experience is to know as one can never know through a textbook or a lecture alone. The use of a microscope, a scalpel, an analytical balance, is more than a training in precision and accuracy. It is an introduction to the more abstract concepts of chemistry, biology, physics, mathe­matics; concepts which are fundamental to an understanding of the world and its people.    Black Mountain supplements the laboratory with its seven hundred acres of lake and mountain country containing for­ests of pine and hardwood, varied minerals, prolific vegetation, swift streams, and native wild-life. Likewise, dairy cattle, and cornfields, small farms and neighborhood industries become  factors in education.    The problems of architecture are the problems of shelter for millions of people. The low cost home of today and the planned community of tomorrow, a more complete use of new materials and new processes, a way of building centered around a way of living: these are architecture's concern, in its plans for a decently housed world.    Architecture classes at Black Mountain do not sped their time discussing a Utopian future. Students design and contruct: an addition to the kitchen or the library, a new dairy barn, quarters for the kitchen staff, a faculty home, a study building. They discover that architecture is hammering nails and pouring cement as well as drawing plans; that it means knowing what houses are for and what they can be, what makes good housing and how it can be better. They find that architects must study ways of life as well as ways of building, that they must know, not only materials and their uses, but people and their needs.    Art at Black Mountain is based upon art as an active, appre­ciative and creative force permeating all activities of life. It attempts to aid the student to see in the widest sense; to open his eyes to his own living, being, doing; to understand the es­sential crafts, tools and materials. Art tudents learn that the experience of creating, constructing, and seeing is not a hobby or a pastime. Even the beginner can sense the exhilaration of creation and while thus giving form to personal ideas relate these ideas to the world in which he lives. Some students evolve art studies of interest to the entire community. Some design and create low-cost materials, furniture, and apparel. Some design and weave textiles suited to widespread indus­trial production, others evolve stage settings and costume tech­niques. Development of an understanding of the meaning of  form extends to form in nature and human beings as well as to works of art.    Music at Black Mountain is not only a part of the curriculum but an essential element of community life. Students and teachers of every interest take part in the instrumental and vocal groups enjoying the experience and discipline that comes from functioning consciously as part of a whole. Their performances are a weekly occurrence. Music is studied as a language with its own innate logic and architecture. Designs in melody, harmony, counterpoint and rhythmics are practiced  as elements of musical architecture and in their mutual  interdependence. The history of music is conceived as an in­tegral part of the culture of a period. The early music studied is sung and played before it is analyzed. A good music library facilitates the practical and theoretical work. Black Mountain believes that in a shaken world of ideas, music as a world of  inner order can help toward developing that community for which we all toil.    Drama is primarily an art form. Yet outside of its literary and creative aspects are other educational values. An actor must live for a while another life; he must discover other ways of thinking and make those ways his own. He must put himself in another place, another time, another situation. From a written outline, he must create a living person.    There is rigid discipline in the necessary surrender of the  personal and the peculiar, in the finding of fundamentals in movement and voice. The actor discovers that motion comes out of emotion; that within the character he assumes, are absolutes of rhythm, tempo, mood. He finds that a play, like a musical performance, is a carefully balanced whole, and that he must always be aware of himself as part of that whole. He realizes that his acting (or it may be his costume design, his  scenery, his lighting) is good only in the degree to which it communicates the ideas of the play and its author, and the attitude of the performers towards those ideas.    Black Mountain's democracy is more than word or concept: it is a way of living. Owned and controlled by its faculty, the College bases this democracy in a unique charter, legally providing for student participation in all community meetings, and students annually agree among themselves on the few basic standards which seem necessary to govern their lives. The community is particularly concerned with the relationship of individuality, community membership, and active citizenship. It finds in the problems of its democracy many of the problems of larger, more complex groups.    Life at Black Mountain demonstrates that for democracy rights and duties are inseparable; that the fundamentals to which America asks allegiance can stand honest investigation and survive the acid test of experience.    Beyond administration or government, democracy means doing things together. It means living with teachers as well as studying with them, making them friends as well as advisors. It means eating together, dancing after dinner, dressing up on Saturday nights, listening to concerts and dadio programs or playing in them. It means freedom in work and freedom in play, and at the same time it means continual community consciousness. It means discussing the problems of politics and philosophy with people of different opinions who have lived through wars and great social upheavals. It means leading a mature self-directed life prepared to face the threats and complexities of a critical age.    The democratic way of life means social equality. It means also equality of obligation and of work. Through the community work program Black Mountain asks of its students and teachers participation in a community citizenship which is far from theoretical. Community work is in no sense ""made"" work, contrived for educational purposes, nor is it a system in which some students become the servants of others. Instead it is work necessary to the operation of the College,  shared voluntarily by community members, and the responsibilities it imposes are real responsibilities. People at the College spend from ten to fifteen hours a week chopping wood, cutting corn, driving the tractor, working in the office. A student may manage the College store; he may report College  news; he may dig a ditch. Most students do several such jobs.    Like Black Mountain's studying, this is hard work. But stu­dents find out important things about themselves and their world: the difference between group and individual projects, the importance of really finishing a job once started, the real excitement in the rhythm of an axe, the power of a truck, the building of a wall; the satisfaction of seeing stones and lumber and concrete and imagination become a place in which to live  and to work. More than this, there is a discovery that the dig­nity of labor and of the laborer is more than a phrase, a dis­covery of causes instead of the casual relationship between theory and practice, of a social consciousness which, divorced from political by-words, finds its meaning in a consciousness of  society as it is and an idea of how it might become better.    If you are interested in the world you live in and the way men think and act; if you are inter­ested  in finding a purpose in your own working and learning, Black Mountain will attract you.    If you are interested in an education which asks the best you have to give; if you are willing to  give yourself to education all day every day; if you can put aside preconceived notions of the world and of yourself, you will like Black Mountain.    Here you will find a college whose faculty consists of a distinguished group of scholars and artists  from America and abroad; whose students represent an economic and geographic cross-section of this country, with several coming from foreign lands; a college whose students are characterized by unnsual vigor, curiosity and self-reliance.    Admission to Black Mountain does not depend upon financial well-being, or on the results of examinations. It depends upon you: upon what you can give to the community and what you can get from it, upon your potentialities as a constructive person, upon your desire for a better world. While admission requirements are flexible they are based upon ability to carry college work. At present applications from qualified high school juniors will be considered.    Fees are adjusted according to ability to pay and vary from $450 to $1200 a year. Those who can  are expected to assume the full cost of their education. Where this is impossible, one may apply in  confidence for a reduced fee scholarship.    Black Mountain is situated in the heart of the Great Craggy Mountains of Western orth Caro­lina,  15 miles from Asheville, a section noted for its climate and scenery. Altitude 2,400 feet.

Sm, IMER PROGRAM 1943  The College program includes: A Summer School ( July 5 - Sept 18)  which is "" the regular SunIDler quarter of the accelerated three­year  undergraduate program of study; A Work Camp ( June 14 -  Sept 18) for those interested in gainine experience in farm-ing  and bUilding while participating in the war effort by  contributing manpower; A Seminar on America for Foreign Scholars  interested in improving the~ r conrr: land of the American language  and in getting contact with a small American cOmnlunity.  Work Campers may attend the entire period or apply for any  specific consecutive period of three weeks or longer.  Fees: Sununer School: ~;; 150 - 0400 for the eleven weeks, inc luding  board, room and tuition. Fee is based upon ability to pay.  ( See catalog)  Work Camp: 012.50 per week. Fee covers cost of room, board,  instruction and supervision, use of tools and College facilities.  Though some workers are able to produce more results than others,  the fee has been based on a good average. An extra tuition  charge is made if the camper takes academic work or wishes tutor­ing  in some sUbject.  Courses: The curriculunl of the Sunmler School will include courses  in American culture and history, psychology, botany, languages  ( Russian, French, Spanish, and German), chemistry and physics,  dramati~ literature and production, music ( both courses in theory  and individual tuition in piano and stringed instruments), funda­mentals  of design in art and textiles, weaving, oUkinetics, and  the dance. Practically the entire winter staff of the College  will teach during the summer session.  Work: Sun1lJ1Cr School students will participa te in the College work ­experience  program oy working several afternoons each week. ~ ork  Campers work fi~ e hou~ s per day in th~ cool of the morning or in  the late afternoon, leaving much of the afternoon and all of the  evening free for relaxation or other activities.  The Work Camp will be devoted mainly to work on the College  farm and to construction and maintenance of the College bUildings  and grounds.  Tho farm work will consist of vegetable gardoning, from soil  preparation to food storage; c~ re and harvesting of feod crops,  such as silage corn, field corn, potatoes, soy beans, barley  and hay; and the utilization of forGst land by clearing for use  as a pasture. The timber cut will be brOUGht to the s:: nvmill for  conversion or cut into firewood for fuel conservation. This work  will be carried out under the direction of faculty sawyers and  wood choppers.  Farm construction will consist of building fences, hog sheltors,  a bull pon, root cellars and chicken houDe.  Community life: The College lives as a community, where everyone eats  together in a common dining hall, serving themselves. The dining  roam, with screened porch overlooking Lake Eden, will be managed  by the College chef, and the kitchen work will be done by a hired  staff. In these days of rationing the ~ ing of our o~ m beef"" and  hogs, m~ lk from our Guernsey herd and fresh vegetables from our  victo~ y gardens all make steady and welcome contributions to our  table.  All contribute to the upkeep of the grounds according to their  ability and interests. All share in the social and recreational  activities such as concerts, lectures, dances and plays. Those  with dramatic or musical talent are ihvited to take part in these  activities. Anyone who plays a musical instrument and desires to  take part in informal ensemble playing should bring his instrument.  The College library and the music library ( inclUding music scores  and records) are ava~ ble to all members of the conmlunity.  There are facinties for SWimming, tennis, badminton, ping  pong and hiking. There are also miles of roads and trails on or  2  adjacent to the campus. Riding horses are available nearby at a  moderate fee.  Climate: An elevation of 2400 feet assures warm but not unduly hot  days and cool, refreshing nights. Summer and sport clothing  including raincoats should be brought. In general people dress  quite simply. Usual daytime wear consista of overall denim  trousers or blue jeans, con~ ortable work shoes and shirts, shorts  or slacks, with a sweater or jacket if it is cool. A light top  coat for especially cool evenings may be desired, There are  occasional semi- formal events at which long dresses are customary.  Men never wear formal evening attire.  Accomodations: Students and campers will live in dormitories which  are summer resort lodges converted to College usc. These are  large rustic frame buildings each with its central lobby and  massive stone fireplace. There are available a limited number  of roams with adjoining baths and several large dormitory attics  with baths and sun decks adjoining. Those attending will thus  have room mates and are expected to care for their rooms. The  . College provides simple furnishings - beds and towels but not  blankets or sheets and pillow cases. Blankets may however be  rented for a small charge which covers necessary dry cleaning  "" and normal wear. Bed linen and towels are laundered by the  College without charge. A laundry room with washing machine  is provided for those who wish to wash their ovm clothing, or  soiled clothes may be sent to the local laundry.  Train and bus connections: Black Mountain is situated directly on  one of the main scenic routes of the Southern Railroad. Round  trip fare from New York: Coach - $ 29.92; "" Pullman - $ 44.00 plus  berth. Individuals will be met at the train by special car at  a charge of 50¢.

We realize that requests for funds are almost over­whelming  in these days of war and preparations for  defense. But the disheartening aspects of world affairs  would be unbearable to all of us if we did not forsee  the possibility of peace and security sometime in the  future. At the same time that we plan for defense we  must plan for peace. At the same time that we plan  for the present we must plan for the future.  To live in this future will require increased intellectual  understanding and civic responsibility as well as hard  practicality. You who are familiar with our aims and  our practices will see how the building program has  particular value in fitting us for this exacting democ­racy.  But, however well- educated we as individuals may  become, the work of the College is obviously much more  widely effective. By influencing the educational trend  of the nation it is one of the many positive directive  forces in the country today. We believe that to give  financial support to Black Mountain College is as i~.  portant as to support the many causes that seem to be  more immediately pressing.  Our needs are modest in comparison with those of  most colleges. We live simply and do as much of our  own work as we efficiently can In consequence we  need ask for money for essentials only.  Since the expiration of our lease makes it necessary  for us to move to our own property by next year, the  most pressing need is to finish the one new building  we have started and to make the old buildings habitable.  We need,  in order to continue work the next semester:  for completing the building $ 19,000  ( if we were not doing almost all the  work ourselves this building alone  would have cost a total of about  $ 53,000)  for repairing and insulating the old  buildings $ 9,000  for the second wing of the new building $ 12,000  Also necessary to house the College next year:  for six fa culty cottages $ 15,000  for furnishings $ 2,000  for quarters for the colored help $ 3,000  for the mortgage $ 12,000  page 5  Photographs and drawings by stILdents of the College  page 6  ~ 1 ~ tairtower  ~ wmdow  fireplace  2 windows  1 door  1 f~ ight  staIrS  1m 1 yard stonework ~  ~""' f  y  ~  11 ~ 18'~ lO'U~  ~ floormg  y ,~  (,  . ~\\\;'  Please make checks payable to Black Mountain College  The Students  WHAT YOUR DOLLAR WILL BUY  Yet the importance of actual building is but a part of our whole educa­tional  program. In order to continue that program, we need your help.  In order to meet our present problem- preparing a permanent loca­tion  for the College- we have cleared land, diverted a stream, cut  away half a hill- side; we have cut the timber for piles, blasted and  hauled rocks for walls, mixed and poured concrete; we have learned  to build stone walls and lay flooring.  Unlike other colleges we derive no income either from taxes or en­dowment.  The College has managed to exist and grow on fairly modest  student fees and on gifts from its friends. It has a faculty which is  willing to make sacrifices in order to teach here. Founded in the depth  of the depression- 1933- the College has had many obstacles to over­come.  page 7",State Archives of North Carolina,"Yandle, Ashley",,,Text; Image;,,,,2013-10-03,2013-10-03,http://cdm16062.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll44/id/634,635.cpd,Volume6/BuildingProjectFlyer.pdf,/p249901coll44/supp/634/index.pdf

Theodore (Ted) Dreier trained as an engineer at Harvard and began working for the General Electric Company (GE). He and Barbara Loines Dreier were married in 1928 and initially lived in Schenectady, New York, GE headquarters. In 1930 Ted Dreier changed his career to education and took a faculty position in physics at Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida. In 1933 John Andrew Rice was fired and a portion of faculty, including Dreier, either resigned or were dismissed during a controversy over academic freedom and tenure at the college. Several of the dissidents then agreed to found a college of their own, in part a response to poor prospects for employment during that bottom year of the Great Depression. At least equally significant, the founders, particularly Rice and Dreier, were inspired by the progressive educational ideals of John Dewey. They envisioned an intimate educational community that would learn, live, and work together (typically farming and later, building projects). Focus was on the development of the whole person and the quest for knowledge as part of a wider aim of learning to use knowledge and of living intelligently. As a reaction to the founders' experience at Rollins College, there would be no outside control via an administration or board of trustees. In essence, the creation of the college was a constructive criticism of higher education based on rigid methods and governance. Named Black Mountain College (BMC) and located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, the college initially drew a small following of former Rollins students and a few recruited from the northeast. Early on the founders decided to stress the practice, not just the study of the arts, and to raise the arts courses to full curricular status. Into this venture, Dreier brought his supportive wife, Barbara, and two young sons. (Another son and a daughter were born in 1937 and 1946, respectively.) The Dreiers remained at BMC until 1949, during which time Dreier taught and served variously as administrator, fund-raiser, treasurer, rector, and served continuously on the Board of Fellows, responsible for the finances of the college and hiring and firing of faculty. The Dreiers possessed and nourished a strong network of family, extended family, and friends, many of whom were highly influential and supportive in a variety of ways of the college and its ideals. From the founding of the college in 1933 until 1949, when the Dreiers departed, Ted Dreier brought to the college a remarkable spirit of adventure, enthusiasm, dedication, and discipline; and he contributed immeasurably to the community's tradition of independent thought and idealism.
